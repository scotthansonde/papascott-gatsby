Freely translated from the <a href="http://kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de/">Nordheide Wochenblatt</a> (30 June 2012):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Brawl on the Highway: a driver goes bezerk over failure to yield</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>When reason fails, some people rather trust their fists. That was the case last Thursday afternoon. The result: an injury and a whole list of charges. A driver from Buchholz (51) nearly cut off another driver (59) while pulling out of a driveway in Jesteburg. Both cars continued towards Lüllau when the older driver motioned for the first driver to stop. Both drivers get out of their cars, and the 59-yr-old driver swung a punch at the 51-yr-old. He was able to block the punch and threw one of his own, losing his cell phone in the process. The female companion of the 59-yr-old then picked up the cell phone and threw it onto a nearby field. Despite an intensive search, the cell phone was not found. A judge is scheduled to tell the two drivers what he thinks of their antics. </p></blockquote>\n<p>(Our son\'s reaction: Which highway was that? I want to find that phone!)</p>',fields:{title:"Brawl on the Highway",date:"30 Jun 2012",url:"https://papascott.de/2012-06-30-brawl-on-the-highway/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2012-06-30-brawl-on-the-highway/",prev:{fields:{title:"Follow Me to Bubble Tea",date:"26 May 2012",slug:"/2012-05-26-follow-me-to-bubble-tea/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Mysterious Invitation",date:"06 Jul 2012",slug:"/2012-07-06-mysterious-invitation/"}}}}}});
