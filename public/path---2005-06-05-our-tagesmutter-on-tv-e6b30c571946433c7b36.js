Even if you can\'t read German, her picture in the sandbox leads the story on the web page.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the story was rather sensationalist, how a unregulated Tagesmutter in Munich used sleeping pills to control the toddlers in her care. Heidi was presented as what a Tagesmutter should be, as well a spokesperson for her professional organization. The film team spent several hours with her, so maybe they will use the material for a future report. Today she was shown for one minute, at the most.</p>\n<p>The story, however, ended on a sexist note, as the reporter noted how many working women depend on Tagesm&uuml;tter... as if fathers had no interest in day care at all.</p>',fields:{title:"Our Tagesmutter on TV",date:"05 Jun 2005",url:"https://papascott.de/2005-06-05-our-tagesmutter-on-tv/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2005-06-05-our-tagesmutter-on-tv/",prev:{fields:{title:"I Love Berlin",date:"04 Jun 2005",slug:"/2005-06-04-i-love-berlin/"}},next:{fields:{title:"McDonald's Europe Names New President",date:"07 Jun 2005",slug:"/2005-06-07-mcdonalds-europe-names-new-president/"}}}}}});
