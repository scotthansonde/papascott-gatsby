We Americans outgrew Mickey and Donald by the time we were 6, but the Germans... they kept reading, even into adulthood, and even now ask for the English word for <em>Entenhausen</em>, the town where Donald and Co. live. (What, it has a name?) My wife still talks today about smuggling Mickey Mouse comics to her cousins in East Berlin.</p>\n<p>Apparently, a big reason for the German fans was the German translator <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Fuchs" title="Erika Fuchs - Wikipedia">Erika Fuchs</a>, who lent the mouse and the duck a literary tongue not found in the original and who helped invent a grammatical form named after her, the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikativ"><em>Erikativ</em></a>, using a verb to express an action in a comic, as in *sigh*, a precursor of emoticons used today in chat and SMS.   </p>\n<p>Erika Fuchs died this week aged 98.
