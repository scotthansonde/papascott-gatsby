While the results of the far-right (9% in Sachsen, 6% in Brandenburg) make nice headlines, they miss the point. The real story is the failure of both main parties to maintain their ground. In both Sachsen (CDU 41.9, SPD 9.5) and Brandenburg (SPD 32.1, CDU 19.4), the two <em>Volksparteien</em> combined for barely over 50%. Neither Schröder nor Merkel/Stoiber/Koch have the confidence of voters in the east.</p>\n<p>The big winners were the post-Communist PDS, finishing strong second in both contests. Does this foreshadow a return of the PDS to the Bundestag in 2006, tipping the result to deny victory to both SPD and Union?</p>\n<p>As for the far right, they\'ve always been utterly incompetent at parliamentary work, so expect the factions to self-destruct sooner than later. The worst thing is that this result entitles the fringe parties to increased state financing, which is based on voter counts. Not that the main parties would ever agree to reform their finances and eliminate such state subsidies. They themselves are too dependent on them.</p>',fields:{title:"Brown Nosing",date:"19 Sep 2004",url:"https://papascott.de/2004-09-19-brown-nosing/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2004-09-19-brown-nosing/",prev:{fields:{title:"Back In Germany",date:"18 Sep 2004",slug:"/2004-09-18-back-in-germany/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Closed For Ever?",date:"19 Sep 2004",slug:"/2004-09-19-closed-for-ever/"}}}}}});
