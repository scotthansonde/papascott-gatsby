Our neighbor <a href="/2001/04/14">Achim</a> raises asparagus, selling directly at his farmplace. We can see the fields from our backyard.

The season is nearly over; the Poles are going home after this weekend.</p>\n<p>It rained all day yesterday for Christopher and Oma Ruth. Christopher was in an excellent mood anyway, racking up many Grandma Brownie Points.
