Yesterday\'s ducks in the German news were <a title="Sommertheater: CDU-Politiker fordert Verkürzung der Ferien auf vier Wochen - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,259747,00.html">a call to shorten school vacations</a> and <a title="tagesschau.de : Politiker machen Front gegen Rauchen" href="http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2105360_TYP6_THE_NAVSPM11172_REF2,00.html">a call for anti-smoking regulations in public places</a>. More interesting, as noted by <a title="Marstonalia" href="http://marston.blogspot.com/2003_08_03_marston_archive.html#106002395376554389">Marstonalia</a>, is the <a title="Home - Leute Heute ZDF Boulevard Berühmtheiten Musik" href="http://leuteheute.douglas.de/out/58.php">online partnership between ZDF and the perfume chain Douglas</a>, which <a title="ZDF: Grenzenlose Nähe - Kultur - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,259821,00.html">may well violate media laws regulating public broadcasting</a>. Not because of the mixing of public and private content, which happens all the time on the air, but because the mix is on the Internet, where ARD/ZDF do not have a license to operate and thus are competing (which public funds?) with private broadcasters and other online media as well. The Internet activities of ARD/ZDF have always been in a grey area of media regulation, and in my opinion should be strictly non-commercial, given their public monopoly in broadcasting. Selling perfume for Douglas is anything but non-commercial.</p>',fields:{title:"Subsidized Advertising",date:"05 Aug 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-08-05-subsidized-advertising/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-08-05-subsidized-advertising/",prev:{fields:{title:"Nacktbloggen - naked blogging",date:"05 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-05-nacktbloggen-naked-blogging/"}},next:{fields:{title:"A Few Tips for Writing Useful Libraries in PHP",date:"06 Aug 2003",slug:"/2003-08-06-a-few-tips-for-writing-useful-libraries-in-php/"}}}}}});
