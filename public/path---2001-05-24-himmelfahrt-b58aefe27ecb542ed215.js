It requires just a 386, and includes drivers for isdn, dsl and ethernet, firewall and NAT functions, and a number of utilities for monitoring from linux or windows clients. And it fits on a floppy disk. I\'ve been using a Debian machine as a router up til now, but this looks promising. I\'ve found it by accident, but it was also mentioned in the latest c\'t (11/2001 p127). <b>Update:</b> Cool, it works!
