Nena'.  She still has the unique voice I'd follow almost anywhere, and the new version of <em>Leuchtturm</em> is quite good and has gotten some radio airplay, so I impulsively picked up the CD yesterday. <em>99 Luftballons</em> doesn't cut it as a ballad, the duets with Kim Wilde and Udo Lindenburg are a bit bizarre, and she ruined my favorite Nena song <em>Nur geträumt</em> (but then again, so did Blümchen, or maybe the song isn't as good as I remember). But I'd forgotten how much I liked <em>Fragezeichen</em>, and all in all it's a nice nostalgia trip back to the '80s. To counteract the nostalgia, I also bought the <a title=\"200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane\" href=\"http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006LJ79\">t.A.T.u.</a> album, which is in fact better than I expected, even though I'm too old to be listening to teenie girl groups, even (or especially) if they are from Russia. But then it's produced the old producer of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, so it's really '80s retro. Sigh. There's no escape.</p>",fields:{title:"",date:"23 Feb 2003",url:"https://papascott.de/2003-02-23-hast-du-etwas-zeit-fuer-mich/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2003-02-23-hast-du-etwas-zeit-fuer-mich/",prev:{fields:{title:"At The Circus",date:"23 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-23-at-the-circus/"}},next:{fields:{title:"You're So Vain",date:"26 Feb 2003",slug:"/2003-02-26-youre-so-vain/"}}}}}});
