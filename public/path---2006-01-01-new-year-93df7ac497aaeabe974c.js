We spent New Years Eve at home and managed to hit a number of <a href="http://german.about.com/library/blsilvester.htm">German New Year\'s Customs</a>, eating raclette (with enough leftovers for a repeat performance tonight), drinking <em>Feuerzangenbowle</em>, and watching <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133551">"Dinner For One"</a> (twice). We skipped the <em>Bleigiessen</em> and the jelly doughnuts. Christopher and I instead napped for a bit before midnight to rest up for the fireworks. Sounds like our evening was pretty much like at <a href="http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2005/12/einen-guten-rutsch-in-das-neue-jahr.html">Christina\'s</a>, where you can read what the New Year\'s greeting "Guten Rutsch" really means.</p>\n<p>Alas, tomorrow is the start of a normal work and kindergarten week. Mama even gets to fly to Munich overnight to start the year. Grandma will be here all week, though.</p>',fields:{title:"New Year",date:"01 Jan 2006",url:"https://papascott.de/2006-01-01-new-year/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2006-01-01-new-year/",prev:{fields:{title:"Equality of the Sexes",date:"01 Jan 2006",slug:"/2006-01-01-equality-of-the-sexes/"}},next:{fields:{title:"Snow Angel",date:"01 Jan 2006",slug:"/2006-01-01-snow-angel/"}}}}}});
