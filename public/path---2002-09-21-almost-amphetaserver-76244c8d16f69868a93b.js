Looking again at <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/news.html">AmphetaDesk</a>, I noticed that there is a hack that makes it much more useful for me: "<a href="http://www.cantoni.org/software/amphetadesk.html">FTPstore</a> is a slight addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in sync. It\'s a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines." So I can keep <a href="/myChannels.opml">myChannels.opml</a> here, and maybe do interesting things to and with it. Stay tuned.</p>',fields:{title:"Almost Amphetaserver",date:"21 Sep 2002",url:"https://papascott.de/2002-09-21-almost-amphetaserver/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2002-09-21-almost-amphetaserver/",prev:{fields:{title:"Say Goodbye",date:"20 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-20-say-goodbye/"}},next:{fields:{title:"First Movie",date:"21 Sep 2002",slug:"/2002-09-21-first-movie/"}}}}}});
