After day care I can just unpack Christopher and let him go in the back yard. Between the rose bushes and the new gate, he\'s not going anywhere, and for activities he can choose between the sand box, the Bobby Car, and playing in the dirt.

The test server is online, but I\'ll let it run a couple of days before I wipe out the file systems on the real server.)</p>\n<p>If there\'s really a Scripting News dinner two weeks from now in Amsterdam, I might go. It\'s a long holiday weekend, the weather should be nice, I haven\'t been to Amsterdam since our honeymoon in 1985, and it\'s just a 5 hour drive. I\'ll see if MamaMaus will give me the weekend off. Or maybe she\'ll come along.</p>'},next:{fields:{title:"Daredevil",date:"08 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-08-daredevil/"}},previous:{fields:{title:"42",date:"13 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-13-42/"}}},{node:{fields:{title:"Daredevil",date:"08 May 2001",slug:"/2001-05-08-daredevil/",tags:"Y2001"},html:"<p>After a successful re-entry to day care and a hard afternoon on the lawn and in the sand box, by 8 pm Christopher was filthy.
