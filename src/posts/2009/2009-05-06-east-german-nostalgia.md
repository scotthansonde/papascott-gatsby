<p>We just saw a news report about a children's museum exhibit on life in East Germany. I first visited East Berlin in 1981, and a lot has changed since then. The Wall is gone. The Palace of the Republic is gone. The DDR itself is gone. But my souvenir of my first visit remains: an original DDR beer opener, with the stamped Retail Sales Price (Einzelhandelsverkaufspreis = EVP) so you know it's authentic!</p>

<p>It's also still functional... buy me a beer, and I can prove it to you! </p>
<p>For the record, at the time 15 DDR Pfennigs was worth about 3 BRD Pfennigs, or somewhat less than 1 US cent.</p>
