<p>It took a bit longer than we hoped, but to make sure you find our restaurant on the Winsener Stra&szlig;e in Hamburg-Harburg we've complemented <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/06/27/interesting-drive/">our sign on the A7 southbound</a> before the Fleestedt exit with one for the A7 northbound.</p>

<p>It's hard to tell from the closeup, but the sign is 12 meters wide and nearly 3 meters high. Here's a wider view.</p>

<p>The sign has to be large to make up for a sub-optimal location 1) on the left side of the Autobahn and 2) right before the exit. Like the sign says, you have to exit <em>now</em>!</p>
