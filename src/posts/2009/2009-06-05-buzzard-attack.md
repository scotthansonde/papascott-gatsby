<p>If you bike through our village, you'll see the following warning as you come into to town...</p>

<p>Yes, our village is protected by an attack buzzard! A couple of years ago  2 cyclists were indeed attacked by a buzzard that was nesting nearby.</p>
<p>However I have no idea how I would defend myself if I were actually attacked by the buzzard? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0K_LZDXp0I">Duck and cover?</a></p>
