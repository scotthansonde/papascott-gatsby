<p>This morning, I had to wait a few minutes before I could enter the kitchen. Mama and Christopher were busy lighting and couning tea canndles on the kitchen table. The first time they had 53 instead of 47, but at this stage of life, what do 6 extra candles really matter?</p>
<p>Since I'm not German, I'm not supersticious about celebrating birthdays early, so I went ahead and bought myself a present a couple of weeks ago, a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_boom.html">Squeezebox Boom network music player</a>. Note the classy and elegant title currently playing. </p>

<p>Just the thing to ease the chore of assembling Ikea furniture, particularly <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10074929">Malm beds in medium brown</a>. If you follow me on Twitter, you know that is how I spent my Friday, well, last Friday. Here is the finished product, and yes, it sleeps as good as it looks. </p>

<p>And so it goes.</p>
