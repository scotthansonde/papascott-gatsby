<p>Nest week we start a new remodelling project... the satellite in Marktkauf Center. The design hasn't changed since it opened nearly 8 years ago:</p>

<p>The designers for McDonald's Europe in Paris have a new series of designs for satellites, and they imagine that our restaurant could look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3443451907" title="View 'Presentation project' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3298/3443451907_46f6006f18.jpg" alt="Presentation project" border="0" width="500" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>The transformation will take just 3 days, and the restaurant will remain open throughout construction. The French models photoshopped into the proposed design are not included. :-)</p>
<p>Note that the central M logo is placed on a green background instead of the traditional red. It' part of a new exterior design scheme that's being implemented in Europe. It's a bit hard to get used to after 50 years of red.</p>
