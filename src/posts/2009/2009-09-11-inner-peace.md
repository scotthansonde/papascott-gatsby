<p><a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/">After 8 years</a>, I think I've found peace. Inner peace, anyway. Outer peace is so hard to find these days. Just ask anyone in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But what has changed in that time? Not much. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_cell#Background">Marienstrasse</a> is still in Hamburg, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Mosque">Al-Quds mosque</a> too. We've sent soldiers abroad, more soldiers in Iraq have fallen than those who fell that day into thin air.</p>
<p>This summer as we were in New York, we took the subway to Ground Zero, to catch a glimpse of hallowed ground. It was a tourist spot, with hawkers and food stands, but inside the fences, even on Saturday, the site was <em>alive</em> with construction work. That comforted me somehow, and we moved on.</p>
<p>But what has changed? Nothing but the passage of time. Time closes all wounds, but are do the wounds really heal? All wounds leave a scar. I wish I could <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/10/five-years/">forget that day</a>, but time moves on and the scars remain.</p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
