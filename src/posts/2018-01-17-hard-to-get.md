title: Hard to Get
---

You'd think in the current German coalition talks that the SPD could at least **play** hard to get.

Now I know German politics is a strange beast, but I would think that the SPD side more has more pull here. The Union is the side that needs desperately to form a coalition with Merkel in charge. The SPD never wanted a new grand coalition (so they claim), you'd think they could take or leave it, and demand a high price to take it.

Then again, what do I know?
