I didn't mention it when I moved from[ GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but for the past couple of months this blog has been hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a platform for building and hosting static websites. 

It works very well with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the software that generates this blog, and means I no longer need to build the site on my own machine to publish it. I just push my changes to my [repository at GitHub](https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io), which Netlify continuously monitors for changes, and the blog it automatically updated, usually within a minute. 

It also offers free one-click managed SSL, a global CDN, and is [free for unlimited single-user sites,](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) whether commercial or personal. 

And combined with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), I can edit and post directly from GitHub and don't need a local jekyll installation at all. But that's a subject for another postâ€¦
