title: Fruit Fly Trap
---
We left some cut flowers in the house too long. The flowers wilted and the kitchen is now full of fruit flies. I made a fruit fly trap with a glass of apple vinegar (with a few drops of dish soap) covered with plastic wrap with some pin holes.

The fruit flies smell the vinegar and struggle through the pin holes to get to it. Once they're in, they forget how they got there and crawl around aimlessly inside the glass until they fall in the vinegar and drown.

There's a lesson there for humans, I'm sure.
