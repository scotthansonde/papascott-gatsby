<p><a title="The Scobleizer Weblog" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/09/24.html#a4798">Scoble</a> made an innocent* post on 'Is Microsoft Evil'. But I kind of got off on a tangent in his <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&amp;comment=4798">comments</a>. I meant to say that Microsoft is no more or less 'evil' than any other large company, and that choosing software because you think one company is morally superior to another is rather silly. But at least my first comment didn't come out as I wanted.</p>
<p>*Since Scoble works for Microsoft, is anything he posts innocent?</p>
