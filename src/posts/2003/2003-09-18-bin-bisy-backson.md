<p>I haven't had much time for posting lately, if you haven't noticed. At work I'm managing a provider, domain and IP switch, which should culminate this weekend when we unplug the router from the old provider. We've also had two electric outages in the past two weeks, which despite the best preparations involve several man-hours of clean-up afterwards. At home I've on single coverage this week as FP runs a pep rally for her company in Bremen. And Christopher's grandmother arrives tomorrow for a 2-1/2 week visit. We've had some nice Indian Summer weather the past couple of days, let's hope it keeps up!</p>
