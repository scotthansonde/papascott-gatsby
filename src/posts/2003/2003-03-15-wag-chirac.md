<p>I don't know all that much about recent French politics, so I found <a title="Chicago Boyz: Wag Le Dog" href="http://chicagoboyz.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_chicagoboyz_archive.html#90713567">this post</a> by Sylvain Galineau (an expat French citizen in Ireland) at Chicago Boyz most interesting and helpful in explaining the French position on Iraq. In short, it's because France pretends it did not lose World War II, and has thus never been able to deal with the aftermath.</p>
