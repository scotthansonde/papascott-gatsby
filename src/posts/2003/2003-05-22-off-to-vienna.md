<p>So I'm off to <a href="http://blogtalk.net">Vienna</a>. I've never used my wireless network card away from home, so if I don't post again until Sunday, you'll know I didn't get it work. I'll be flying with <a href="http://www.hebig.com/">Heiko</a>, and I hear that <a href="http://www.hebig.org/blog/">Haiko</a> is picking us up... that's <i>HIGH-ko</i> and <i>HEY-ko</i>, and I hope I don't get confused.</p>
<p>If you're looking for me at the conference, I'll be the one wearing the blue cap with the dead fish who's not paying very much attention to the presentations.</p>
