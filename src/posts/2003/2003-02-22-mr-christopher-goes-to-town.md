<p>The adventure for Christopher and me today was a trip to Hamburg. We parked at Berliner Tor and took the U-Bahn to <a href="http://www.landungsbruecken.de/hamburg.htm">Landungsbrucken</a>, the gateway to the <a href="http://www.hafen-hamburg.de/html-engl/home.htm">Hamburg Harbor</a>. There I treated Cristopher to a harbour tour on the <a href="http://www.louisiana-star-hamburg.de/">Louisiana Star</a>, and we drank capuccino and hot chocolate as we looked at the big container ships. We then went downtown and took a look at the home electronics store <a href="http://www.saturn.de/">Saturn</a>. This was Christopher's first long outing without the buggy, so he walked the entire day and came home exhausted.</p>
