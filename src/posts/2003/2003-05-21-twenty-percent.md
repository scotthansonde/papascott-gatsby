<p>At work, it looks like things might be coming together for <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/05/08/2214.php">reduced hours</a> starting June 1. The proposal for our department is an across-the-board 20% reduction. That means we can work 4 day weeks, or work 2 half-days and 3 full-days or whatever. The state (un)employment office will cover 60% of lost wages for 6 months. That's a solution that's fair and that I can live with, although I don't really have any confidence that things will be better in 6 months, either with my present employer or the job market in general.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my new <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html">Nokia 3650</a> cell phone arrived last night, and Mama had what she called 'car pornography' (brochures for the <a href="http://www.bmw.de/de/produkte/automobiles/index2.html?model=5series">new BMW 5 series</a>), so we each had our entertainment last night after Christopher was asleep.</p>
