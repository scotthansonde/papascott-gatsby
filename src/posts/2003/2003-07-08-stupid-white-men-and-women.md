<p>Interesting that the current top two entries on the <a title="Kultur - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/charts/0,1518,sachbuch,00.html">Spiegel non-fiction bestseller list</a> are both American,  namely Michael Moore "Stupid White Men" and Hillary Clinton "Living History" (and number 7 is Emmanuel Todd "World Power USA: An Obituary", a book I'm not familiar with but the title seems to say it all).  My conclusion: Germans are very interested in reading about the United States, but only to have their prejudices confirmed.</p>
