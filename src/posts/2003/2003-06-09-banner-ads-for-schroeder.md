<p>At least twice when browsing through German online news sites, I've run into the following banner ad for Schröder's reform package 'Agenda 2010':</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Themen-A-Z/-,9757/Agenda-2010.htm" title="Everyone's talking about Schröder's plans. _Here_ they are. Agenda 2010."><img alt="banner_hfett.gif" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/banner_hfett.gif" width="468" height="60" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The link goes to the <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de">official government web site</a> (<a href="http://eng.bundesregierung.de/frameset/index.jsp">English</a>). Now, I know the line between partisan politics and government in a parliamentary democracy is rather fuzzy, and it's not like, say, Schröder is sending the Bundesgrenzschutz to round up opposition state legislators for a quorum call. But it's still a little strange to see the government spending tax money to advertise for  itself.</p>
<p>Then again, I guess the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House web site</a> isn't that much different.</p>
