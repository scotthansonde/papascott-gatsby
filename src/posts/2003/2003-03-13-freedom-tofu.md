<p>I'm with <a title="Heiko Hebig | hebig.com | Oh this is for REAL?" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/000983.html">Heiko Hebig</a> on this issue. If we're going to have Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast, we cannot stop there. If we are really going to do the weasels in, we need Freedom Burgers instead of Hamburgers, and Freedom Weenies instead of Frankfurters. That is, until the US Congress starts reading the <a href="http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/">Aardvark</a>, then the Weenies will have to go as well. Freedom Sausages? Wait, aren't those Vienna Sausages?</p>
<p>And what about <a href="http://allrecipes.iwon.com/encyc/terms/B/5486.asp">Braunschweiger</a>?</p>
