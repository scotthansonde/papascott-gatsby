<p>My <a title="PapaScott: Windmills over Lüllau" href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/09/27/2600.php">windmill</a> post has gotten <a title="E-Business Weblog/Newsfeed" href="http://www.roell.net/weblog/newsfeed/2003/10/04.shtml#003552">some</a> <a title="Wind Energy Primer by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001565.shtml">attention</a> as it contains some good comments pro and con on wind energy in general. I should have expected that, since readers would certainly care more about the general issue than about my backyard (or even the property value of my backyard). </p>
<p>I'm actually finding the organizational effort more interesting than the issue itself. This evening about 30 of us will be meeting and will probably formally form a community action group. I'm wondering, wouldn't a weblog be the perfect tool for such a fledgling group? I'll try to explain the concept to my neighbors the best I can. Do any of you know of basic user documention (as opposed to setup/admin documentation) for Movable Type in German?</p>
