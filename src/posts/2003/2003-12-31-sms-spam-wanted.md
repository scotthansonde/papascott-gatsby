<p>Russell Beattie <a title="Russell Beattie Notebook" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1005546.html">wants you to send him an SMS</a> for the New Year. Maybe I should give his number to my cell provider <a href="http://www.eplus.de/">e-plus</a>? They send enough SMS spam to keep anyone happy!</p>
