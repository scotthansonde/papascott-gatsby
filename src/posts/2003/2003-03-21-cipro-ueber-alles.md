<p>Thanks to some powerful antibiotics, it looks like our trip to Berlin can go on as planned. If you hear about any damage in Berlin this weekend, remember, it might not be anti-war protesters. It might be Christopher.</p>
<p>I'm in bed, but feeling better. The wi-fi reception is good and I can read about the news in Iraq without having to endure the droning TV coverage. The prescription was my first experience with 'aut idem'. My doctor prescribed Ciprobeta, but the pharmacist didn't have that brand in stock and asked if she could substitute Ciprohexal.</p>
