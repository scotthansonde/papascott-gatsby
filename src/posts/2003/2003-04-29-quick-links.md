<p>You may have noticed that I've been having fun the past fews days with quick links in my sidebar, a lá <a title="anil dash " href="http://dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a>. It's a way I can archive a link and snap off a comment or two without taking up a lot of column inches (vertical pixels?) on the home page. Technically, I set up a second blog for the quick links with a very simple index page, which gets included here via php.</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure if the sidebar is the right place to put them, seeing as there will (hopefully) be a lot more of them than regular posts. One option is to aggregate them into a single post of their own each day (a lá <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/links/aoeabaofheecf.html">0xDECAFBAD<a> or <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/23/in_brief_insomniac_edition.html">diveintomark</a>). But I don't want to break the flow, if you know what I mean. The other questions are whether I should ping weblogs.com when I add a quick link (probably not) or whether I should include them in my RSS feed (maybe).</a></a></p>
