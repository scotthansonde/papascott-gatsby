<p>We spent New Year's at home with Christopher. We prepared a simple raclett (gouda cheese, not the real stuff) and fascinated Christopher with a <a href="http://www.britannia.org/recipes/showrecipe.php?RecipeID=00000104">Feuerzangenbowle</a> (punch laced with flaming rum-soaked sugar). For the first time ever we bought fireworks that were going to show him, but he pooped out about 10 pm, so we had to wait impatiently until midnight to shoot them off without him. Today we moped around the house, reading (Mama a mystery, Christopher his new airplane book, me a tech book on <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon</a>).</p>
<p>Here's wishing everyone a happy and healthy 2003!</p>
