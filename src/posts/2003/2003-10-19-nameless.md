<p>The DNS at my <a href="http://www.united-domains.de/">domain provider</a> has gone down, so you may have trouble reading this blog for a while. In fact, if you are reading this post, either the problem has gone away, or your browser hasn't noticed it yet. My IP is <a href="http://213.73.82.31">213.73.82.31</a>, but I don't expect anyone to remember that. The whole point of DNS is that we don't have to memorize IPs. Except, of course, when DNS is broken. Like now. </p>
<p><b>Update</b> The problem lasted only a couple of hours. Things are better now.</p>
