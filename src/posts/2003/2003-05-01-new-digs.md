<p>This afternoon PapaScott moved to its own virtual server, running on FreeBSD and hosted by <a href="http://www.escapebox.net">EscapeBox</a> in Berlin. The DNS change will have propagated by noon tomorrow, so until then you might get redirected to the new IP address. </p>
<p>I'd been considering for several weeks now whether to move PapaScott to a dedicated or virtual server. Not that I need it. The site is pretty low tech and low volume, and doesn't require any great amounts of CPU or bandwidth. I just wanted to be root! I set up web servers on FreeBSD and Linux for a living, and I wanted to be able to set up my web server the way I want to, install the latest PHP if I feel like it, or try out Tomcat. And to able to break things, although I don't expect to break anything.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001126.htm">Burningbird's</a> <a hef="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001131.htm">quest</a> for a <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001138.htm">new server</a>, I started searching around, discovered a couple of hosters that have excellent reviews, and made my choice.</p>
<p>I still highly recommend <a href="http://www.cornerhost.com">Cornerhost</a> as a hoster for anyone who does not want or need root.</p>
