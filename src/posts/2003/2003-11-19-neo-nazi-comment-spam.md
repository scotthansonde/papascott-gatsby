<p>An interesting twist on comment spam. My latest post on <a title="PapaScott: Hohmann Go Home" href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/11/2694.php">Martin Hohmann</a> attracted a generic comment linking to a neo-Nazi news site. I've removed the links, and closed discussion on that post, but I've left the comment and the URLs for the sake of discussion. The comment <em>is</em> vaguely on-topic (as the post is on anti-semitism), and even neo-Nazis have the right to free speech. But on my blog?</p>
<p><b>Update</b> Actually, since PapaScott is hosted with a German domain on a German host, and is therefore subject to German law,  neo-Nazis do <em>not</em> have a right to free speech on my blog.</p>
