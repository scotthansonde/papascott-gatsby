<p>I got this mail from work after I left yesterday, regarding a PC I care for: "I put dathon on your desk. CPU and graphic card were defective, and as I tried to boot it, there were also disk errors! Maybe you can still save something... we do have spare disks."</p>
<p>Does anything in the machine still work? Anything? Looks like it will be a fun morning...</p>
