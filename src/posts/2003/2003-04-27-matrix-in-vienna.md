<p>I've got my flight and I'm getting my hotel set for the <a title="BlogTalk - A European Weblog-Conference" href="http://blogtalk.net/">BlogTalk</a> conference in Vienna, May 23/24. However, the film <a title="The Matrix Reloaded" href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/">The Matrix Reloaded</a> opens in Germany and Austria the very same weekend. Is anyone interested in organizing a group to check it out? I imagine either before or after the actual conference (i.e. Thursday or Saturday evening) would be best. There are English theatres in Vienna, of course, but German would be OK with me. But it would probably be good to reserve tickets. Leave me a <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/04/27/2156.php">comment</a>, send me a <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#104;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">mail</a>, or leave a note at the <a title="Bloggers at Blogtalk - QuickTopic bulletin board" href="http://www.quicktopic.com/21/H/x5bvCiC6qMs">BlogTalk bulletin board</a>.</p>
<p>On a related note: <a title="The Aardvark Speaks :: Horst Prillinger's weblog" href="http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/">Horst</a>, are you still planning  on skipping town that weekend?</p>
