The march attempted to reach the gates of the US Consulate, and <a title="Erst wars friedlich, dann gabs Gewalt - Diskussionen über Polizeieinsatz" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/03/25/137948.html">things</a> <a title="Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Anti-war protests span the globe" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,12809,920898,00.html">got</a> <a title="novinite.com" href="http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=20874">ugly</a>.
