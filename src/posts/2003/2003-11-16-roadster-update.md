<p>In defence of the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/13/2701.php">Roadster</a> incident, MamaMaus offers this picture (taken for insurance purposes) of the gas pump in question, which at the bottom carries a V-Power sticker on the <em>diesel</em> side of the pump. Therefore, at first glance, it is not totally stupid to believe that V-Power is some sort of souped-up diesel.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see who ends paying for the damage. Unless, of course, it comes out of our pocket, in which case it would be not interesting, but tragic.</p>
