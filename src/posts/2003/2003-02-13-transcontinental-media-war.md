<p>Fellow expat <a title="Adam Curry's Weblog" href="http://live.curry.com/2003/02/12.html#a3078">Adam Curry</a> wonders how he missed the "growing anti-americanism in Europe". It seems to exist only in the media. I'm not so prominent as Adam, so the media never asked me about it, but I to agree. I have never personally experienced any sort of anti-Americanism at all here in Germany. There's no talk of boycotting trips to the US, or boycotting American products (well, except for Microsoft products :-). </p>
<p>I'm not going to say whether it's good or bad, but Americans seem to be more <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/02/Clashofcultures.shtml">emotional and sentimental</a> about things, feeling that their friendship has been betrayed. France opposes war with Iraq, and the US media accuses France of being <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/02102003/index.shtml">ungrateful</a> for D-Day. I'd guess most Europeans don't see the connection.</p>
<p>There are calls in the US to boycott French wine and Perrier water. Shouldn't they be boycotting Chrysler and T-Mobile as well?</p>

Although if I were forced to choose between war and Germany <em>Volksmusik</em>, I'd almost choose war.</p>
