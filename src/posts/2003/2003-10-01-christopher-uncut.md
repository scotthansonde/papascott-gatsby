<p><a href="http://papascott.typepad.com/photos/cologne/"><img alt="Christopher Uncut" src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/10/koeln_crhmama.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" align="right" /></a>Now that we have a working camera again, we've been reminded by various grandparents that it is our parental duty to upload masses of Christopher photos to the Internet. I've set up a <a href="http://papascott.typepad.com/photos/cologne/">test album at TypePad</a>, and now you can see Christopher attempting to rebuild a historical Roman wall in downtown Cologne. Note that the images are repetitive and might be boring to non-family members.</p>
