<p>At work we have typical German work contracts which can be terminated with 6 weeks notice before the end of a quarter. The next termination date is next Wednesday, and there are rumors that there will be layoffs announced for the end of the year, despite our having worked short time for the past 6 months. One of sysadmins decided not to wait and found something new. That makes the jobs for the rest of us sysadmins more secure (assuming we stay in business), but it also means we all have more work. And more bullet points for the CV.</p>
<p>Among other things, I'll now be responsible for all our Linux installations, about 60 workstations and a dozen servers. I'll be the resident Linux expert, except that I don't feel like an expert at all. Sure, I've been using Linux for nearly 10 years, but I haven't been keeping up with the latest developments, and lately I've been happy to run a stock commerical distribution (Mandrake at work, SuSE at home). So I have some learning to do. At least it beats learning Windows.</p>
