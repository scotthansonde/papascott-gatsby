<p>Meanwhile at work, our CEO announced that she is leaving at the end of the month, i.e. tomorrow. I don't want to say that she was unpopular in our department, but someone hung a 'Ding Dong' sign on our door, citing the <a title="Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead!" href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/thewizardofoz/dingdongthewitchisdead.htm">song</a> from the Wizard of Oz.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CTO is taking over for her and we'll have to get by with just two board members for the time being. Just as well, we're cutting costs all over the place and are planning no increase in sales, and are hoping to break even on the year. To put things in perspective, our sales for a year are equal to the sales in Mama's division for two weeks. And most weeks she makes a profit.</p>
