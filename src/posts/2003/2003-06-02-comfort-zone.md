<p>Wonderful weather today. Sunny with light clouds, slight breeze, 28&deg;C (83&deg;F). But most folks around here are complaining that it's too hot. One could think that Germans just always like to complain about the weather. I'm more polite and say that they have a narrow comfort zone. (I will admit, though, that most buildings here are not designed for maximum comfort in warm weather.)</p>
<p>Hot, by the way, begins at 40&deg;C.</p>
