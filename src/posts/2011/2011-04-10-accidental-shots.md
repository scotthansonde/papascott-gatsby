<p>We had sponsor tickets for yesterday's HSV match against Dortmund (we applied for the tickets last summer, so I obviously knew in advance that Dortmund would do well this year). I couldn't connect to Twitter in the stadium, so you'll have to take our word for it that we were there.</p>
<p>The sun was shining, the Dortmund fans were plentiful and in a good mood (Christopher thought it was funny that they were singing children's songs with, um, slightly altered lyrics), and in the end noone lost, so a good time was had by all.</p>
<p>I brought along our new camera, a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004026PE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=papascott-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B004026PE4">Canon PowerShot SX130 IS</a>, to see how the zoom worked. Not bad for a 150 general purpose camera, but all you can do is point at a spot, hope for the action to get there, and get an accidental shot. The picture of Frank Rost cleaning the toilet paper out of his goal before kickoff is good, though.</p>
