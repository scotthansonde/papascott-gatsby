My gmail address is fairly generic, and apparently there are other people who would like to be PapaScott but can't. So I get a fair amount of mail intended for other PapaScotts, including:

* confirmation for my tee time at a golf club in Pennsylvania
* notice of automatic deposit of my salary from the State of Tennessee
* my reservation for one week at a mobile home park in Georgia
* advertising from a car dealer in Argentina
* an appeal in French to donate (or sell, I can't tell) my blood plasma to a clinic in Paris
* invitation of regular lunches of ex-military folks in Tennessee
* regular notices of transactions (with scans of receipts) from my Well Fargo bank account in Georgia

And I'm not even looking in my spam folder. I have enough keeping track of my own schedule without having to worry items for total strangers!
