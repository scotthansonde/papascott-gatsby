title: papascott.de is now scotthanson.de
---
I'm rebranding! I'm now using my name as my digital identity.

"PapaScott" arose from a whim when I [started my blog](https://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/05/it-worked/) on [edithispage.com](http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/12/08/editthispagecom.html) in December 1999, since we were going to become parents that very month. My wife and I were calling each other PapaScott and MamaMaus, as silly expectant parents will do. I ended using PapaScott as my handle for most services when signing up. 

I've been changing my handles to ["ScottHansonDE"](https://twitter.com/ScottHansonDE) over the past few months. I've been reviving my blog over the past few weeks, and I've done the same here. The new blog has a new [design](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo) ([thanks yinka!](https://yinkakun.vercel.app/)) and a new back end ([eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)). I've put my posts from 2021 there to get started. So from now on follow me on [scotthanson.de](scotthanson.de), if you like!
