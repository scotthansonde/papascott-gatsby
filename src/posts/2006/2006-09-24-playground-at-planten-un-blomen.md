<p>MamaMaus had to work today, but she took us along to Hamburg so we could go watch <a href="http://hamburg-freezers.de/">ice hockey</a>. But the highlight for Christopher was the big playground (St. Petersburger Straße) at the <a href="http://www.plantenunblomen.hamburg.de/">Planten un Blomen</a> park. It was new for us, too. They have a lot of water toys, (hand pumps, dams with trenches, even a water slide) and it was so warm today he was sorry we didn't bring his swim suit.</p>
