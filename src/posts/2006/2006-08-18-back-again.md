<p>We're back in Germany, in body if not yet in spirit. The brain takes a couple of days to catch up.</p>
<p>Our return with Northwest Airlines was a mixed bag. Internet check-in and seat selection is cool. Flying 25-year-old DC-10s in this day and age is not. We arrived 3 hours before take-off, taking the travel advisories into consideration, but despite the warnings ecurity was so fast we ended up consuming liquids in the airport bar for 2 hours before boarding.</p>
