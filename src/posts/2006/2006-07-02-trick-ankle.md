<p>After running 5K in the Buchholzer Stadtlauf last year, MamaMaus has been looking forward to running 10K this year. The big race was today, her firm was a main sponsor and she started together with a dozen colleagues. The weather was warm, but a a breeze kept things from getting too hot.</p>

<p>Alas, she never finished. About 500m into the run she stepped on a plastic bottle that someone had dropped, her ankle gave way, and fell in agony to the ground. The medics took her away in an ambulance, and her race was over. She has torn ligaments in the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/18/injured-reserve/">same ankle</a> as in 2003, and will be limping for 4 weeks. Good thing we didn't toss out the crutches.</p>
<p>And she'll miss the World Cup final in Berlin next weekend.</p>
