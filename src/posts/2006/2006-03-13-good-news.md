<p>In good news, <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/05/life-sucks/">my brother</a> will be out of the hospital tomorrow. The biopsy last week revealed a cancer very similar to that he had 15 (not 10) years ago which responded very well to chemotherapy. In fact, he was much more comfortable after just one treatment. They've done the first set at the University hospital, and the remaining sets he'll be able to do closer to home. I imagine he'll be wearing a cap quite a bit the next few weeks.</p>
<p>With phone calls to the States costing less than one cent per minute, I'm sure our international phone bill this month will skyrocket to at least 3 Euros. </p>
