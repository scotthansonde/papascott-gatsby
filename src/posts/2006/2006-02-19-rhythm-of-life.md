<p>"I want to see a film from the computer", Christopher just asked, "the one with men drinking beer and walking backwards." It took me a couple of minutes to realize he meant the <a href="http://www.framestore-cfc.com/press/05pr/051003noitulove/" title="Framestore CFC Press Release">Guinness Rhythm of Life spot</a> that was making the rounds <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/guinness%20%22rhythm%20of%20life%22" title="Technorati Search: guiness rhythm of life">4 months ago</a>. How could he remember that?</p>
