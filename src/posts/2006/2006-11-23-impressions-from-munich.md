<p>Mama and I were in Munich for a 25 hours last weekend. I hadn't been in Munich for a few years, here are a few impressions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't people have anything better to do than walk down the Neuhauser Straße? I know it's the main pedestrian street town, but it was jam packed every time we were there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We each bought shoes on the Neuhauser Straße, since everyone knows you can't buy shoes in Hamburg. (Inside family joke, ask <a href="http://www.naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/">Kirsten</a>. The punch line, by the way, is "Kassel".)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We saw lots of good food at <a href="http://www.dallmayr.de/">Dallmayr</a>, <a href="http://www.feinkost-kaefer.de/">Käfer</a> and the Viktualienmarkt, but we didn't buy any. We were tempted by some cheeses, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also heard a lot of foreign languages on the street. I don't mean German dialects like Bavarian or Swabian or familiar foreign languages like we hear in Hamburg (Russian, Turkish, etc.), but languages I don't hear every day like Italian and American English. I'd always thought of Munich as a German ghetto, maybe I've been wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our formal gala event was held in a riding hall which had been converted to a event center. Around here we still have horses, and riding halls are used for, well, riding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heidi Klum was supposed to show up but she was too pregnant. She sent a video, though. The a cappella group <a href="http://www.n7house.de/">Naturally7</a> performed, and they were quite good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absolute highlight were the beds at the hotel. We have never slept so well as at the Hotel Sofitel. Their <a href="http://www.sofitel.com/sofitel/gb/mybed/index.shtml">MyBed</a> is so good they even <a href="http://eu.soboutique-hotelsathome.com/EN/mybed.html">sell the complete MyBed</a> on the internet, should you want to drop a couple of thousand Euros on a bed. We're tempted to at least buy the pillows and the featherbed. It was that good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
