<p><a href="http://www.ndrinfo.de/">NDRInfo</a> radio this morning broadcast a short profile of Volkswagen brand chairman <a href="http://www.volkswagen-ag.de/english/docs/2a-bernhard.html">Wolfgang Bernhard</a>, the cost-cutting manager who formerly worked for Chrysler in the US. He's apparently very dry and businesslike. When asked the difference between working in the US and in Germany, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In Germany I am called Dr. Bernhard, in the US I was called Wolfgang. Otherwise the problems are just the same.
</p></blockquote>
<p>An attempt to make the interview more personal failed. "How do you relax in your spare time?"</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I sleep.
</p></blockquote>
