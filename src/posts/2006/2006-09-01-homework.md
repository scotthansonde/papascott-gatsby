<p>Christopher working on his first homework assignment, a flower that is to be colored for the <em>Einschulung</em> tomorrow. He was supposed to color one leaf each day for 10 days, but he must take after Papa... he put everything off until the last minute.</p>
<p>His original <a href="http://shop.lego.com/product.asp?p=K10006&amp;cn=223&amp;d=21&amp;t=7">Lego Bionicle <em>Schulranzen</em></a> (schoolbag) is in the background, loaded with the required materials. All systems are go!</p>
