<p>My son was born 30 years to late to believe it, but <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/06/09/11805.html">kottke</a> gets it right. The movies don't have numbers, they're called Star Wars, Empire, and Jedi. Some lame prequels came later. And Han shot first. Really.</p>
<p>I doubt that I'll buy the new original version DVDs, though. How much money does George Lucas need, anyway.</p>
