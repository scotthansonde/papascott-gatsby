<p>We just returned from camping. The weather was perfect: mostly sunny, slightly breezy, dry, and warm enough for short sleeves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was only perfect for one hour as we were packing to leave. Otherwise, the weather was mostly miserable. Rain on Saturday, wind on Sunday, and <a href="http://www.wetter.com/v2/?SID=&amp;LANG=DE&amp;LOC=7003&amp;LOCFROM=0202&amp;type=WORLD&amp;id=45769&amp;size=&amp;requested_values%5B%5D=temp_c&amp;start_d=03&amp;start_m=06&amp;start_y=2006&amp;end_d=05&amp;end_m=06&amp;end_y=2006&amp;local_utc=local&amp;x=33&amp;y=3">mostly cold</a> for June (low was 5&deg;C this morning). </p>

<p>We made do the best we could. Here's the crew huddled in one of the tents. </p>
<p>On Sunday we visited the <a href="http://www.erlebnisbahn-ratzeburg.de/">Erlebnisbahnof Schmilau</a>, an old railway station converted into a living musueum. We didn't feel up to a 2-hour trip with a handcar, but we did rent a <a href="http://6teambike.com/">6teambike</a>, a bicycle built for six, for an hour-long round trip.</p>
