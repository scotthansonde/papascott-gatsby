<p>Sometimes good things do come to those who wait. Last week MamaMaus was offered comp VIP tickets for the World Cup match Saudi Arabia - Ukraine in Hamburg. We got free food and drink, the weather was comfortable (after a thunderstorm cooled things off just before kick-off), there were a lot of goals, and we had a good time. </p>
<p>The seats were good too, just behind the Ukraine bench. We were in the same row as Uwe Seeler, and we could see FIFA President Blatter a few rows below. </p>

<p>Priceless, as in no price listed, and may not be sold. </p>

<p>Football with champagne and hors d'oeuvres. And Budweiser. There were several levels of VIP as far as I could tell. We were at 2nd or 3rd level.</p>

<p>MamaMaus likes the kids as player escorts.</p>
