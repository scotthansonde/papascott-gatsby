<p>This is Hermann, our new family member for the next 10 days. Christopher brought him home from Kindergarten, and he seems to be a sourdough of some sort. If we treat him right, he will give birth to 3 Hermann-children, and we can bake a cake.</p>
<p>Until then, though, he has to be cared for quite carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1. Hermann needs rest. </li>
<li>Days 2-4. Hermann needs exercise. Stir once each day.</li>
<li>Day 5. Hermann is hungry! Feed him with 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. He then needs a bigger bowl, otherwise he will run away.</li>
<li>Days 6-9. Hermann needs time to digest. He needs a daily walk. Stir once each day.</li>
<li>Day 10. Feed again with 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk.</li>
</ul>
<p>He is then ready to give birth to 3 children (1 cup each, to be given to good friends), and with the rest we can bake a cake (recipe to follow, or just <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=86155837&amp;size=l" title="Photo Sharing">click</a> on the photo).</p>
<p>Christopher has already memorized the instructions and is making sure we follow them to the letter. Today is Day 1, and despite the rest Hermann seems to have a bad case of gas. We've had to open the cover several times.</p>
