<p>The Second Whiney Expat Bloggers in Germany Meet Up <a href="http://www.jbittner.com/germany/2006/07/second-whiney-expat-bloggers-in.html">will take place in Bonn on 18 &amp; 19 November 2006</a>.</p>
<p>I'll try to be there, and I'll bring recordings of Christopher in a bad mood so I don't have to do any whining myself.</p>
