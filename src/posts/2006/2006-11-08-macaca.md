<p>Noone appreciated my <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3082">election day humor</a> at lumma.de, so I'll repeat myself here. Nico offered the famous quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I tend to think politicians should be changed often, just like diapers, and for exactly the same reason.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He suggested it applied just as well to Germany, to which I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Does that mean grand coalitions need to be changed more frequently?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you, thank you, I'm here all week. Or until the recount in Virginia is over.</p>
