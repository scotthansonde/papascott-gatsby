<p>It's a slow news Sunday in December, so everyone is reporting that <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html">Time Magazine as picked You.</a> (capitalized with a full stop) as its person of the year. I guess that means we'll have a repeat winner next winner next year, unless they pick themselves (or, as <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/12/17/it-has-always-been-us/">Jeff Jarvis suggests, God</a>).</p>
<p>I guess they didn't tell their sponsors in advance, since the <a href="http://cache.ultramercial.com/d/005-434/chrysler_flash.html">flash ad leading to the story</a> starts with "You might not be Time Person of the Year".</p>
