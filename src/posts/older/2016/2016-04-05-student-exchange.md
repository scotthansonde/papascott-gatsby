We have an exchange student from Italy with us this week (his family hosted our son for a week last fall). We were a bit worried about how to keep him occupied, since we're out in the country and far from the school. We needn't have worried. The students (hosts and guests) hang out in L端neburg after school and they only come home to sleep.

BTW, German is cool in that it was a different word for grade and high school students *(Sch端ler)* than for college students *(Studenten)*. We're talking about *Sch端ler* here. And that my wife and I met when she was an [exchange student](https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/17/and-i-saw-her-standing-there/) *(Sch端ler)* in Minnesota is totally beside the point!
