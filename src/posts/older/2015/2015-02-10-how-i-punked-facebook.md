<p>It took me nearly two years, but I finally did it. I was able to get the better of Facebook. Yesterday I was able to celebrate my birthday without a single greeting on social media, even if my wife very nearly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/papascott/posts/10152947844446281y">gave me away</a>.</p>
<p>It was heaven! It was bliss! I was living free of the distractions of the digital world, if only for one day. My day! For me, me alone!</p>
<p>I hope your day was a good one too.</p>
