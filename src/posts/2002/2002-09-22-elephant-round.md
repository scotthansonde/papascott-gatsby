<p>Two hours after the polls close, the party leaders come traditionally to an "elephant round" discustion broadcast simultaneously on the two main networks ARD and ZDF. Usually the election is decided and the consequences are discussed. Tonight, nothing is decided yet, and the elephants have nothing yet concrete to say. </p>
<p>Schröder can most likely continue to govern. The PDS is out. The FDP has lost big, thanks to Möllemann. The Union and the Greens have made gains. The result could depend on 'overhang representitives' for the two main parties. At this point, it is sure that a government will not depend on the PDS, and that a grand coalition will not be necessary. For that, at least, we can be thankful.</p>
