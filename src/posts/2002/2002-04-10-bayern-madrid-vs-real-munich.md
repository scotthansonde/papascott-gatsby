<p>I  just watched this Champion's League quarterfinal, but I'm not sure why. They are each the most loved but even more hated team in their country. Just like Juventus Manchester vs United Turin would be. The only American example I could think of would be the (pre-parity) Cowboys vs the Yankees, if they played the same sport.</p>
