<p>Despite all the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings">wailing and gnashing of teeth</a> over the changes in the Google indexing algorithm, I'm not complaining. I own my blog name. I the one and only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=PapaScott">PapaScott on Google</a>. And perhaps the entire Internet? Alas, no. Some domain grabber last year registered the domain <a href="http://whois.userland.com/default$papascott.com">papascott.com</a>.  I have no idea why. The registraion expired last month, and I would kind of like to take the domain for myself, but not enough that I'd pay extra for it or anything.</p>
