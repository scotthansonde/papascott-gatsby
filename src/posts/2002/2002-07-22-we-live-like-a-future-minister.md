<p>This evening the ARD news magazine <a href="http://www.mdr.de/fakt">FAKT</a> had a segment on working women in Germany. One family they showed was much like ours. The career mother has a better job than the father, who has to be be somewhat flexible, but both work full time while the child is cared for by a <i>Tagesmutter</i>. Only at the end did I realize they were showing Stoiber's advisor on family and social policy <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2002/07/16/1810.php#001810">Katherina Reiche</a>, about whom I posted a few days ago. So I guess we shouldn't be jealous of the lifestlyes of politicians, although it would still be nice to get some <a href="http://kleist.dwelle.de/english/current_affairs/currentaffairs1.html">money from lobbyists</a>.</p>
