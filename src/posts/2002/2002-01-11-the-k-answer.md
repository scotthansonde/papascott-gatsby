<p>BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1755000/1755686.stm">German right settles election rivalry</a><br />
BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1756000/1756007.stm">Edmund Stoiber: Bavaria's 'pitbull'</a><br />
So it's Stoiber after all. A safer but less interesting choice than Merkel, but in my opinion the easier opponent for Schröder, especially since the economy seems to be bottoming out right now and the election is not until September.</p>
