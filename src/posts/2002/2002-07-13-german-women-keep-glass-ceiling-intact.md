<p>A FAZ link for Mama: <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCE-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;doc={080C60DD-C5AD-416C-99B0-DDA3F1720C45}">German women keep glass ceiling intact - Business careers foresaken for motherhood</a> "The share of women managers at the top echelons in Germany is 3.7 percent, according to the European Union's statistical office, Eurostat. Even in junior management, the share of women has stagnated at around 10 percent.... Well-educated women in their thirties recognize that, although a career sounds glamorous, it requires a tremendous amount of hard work. Fed up with the constant fights over positions and budgets, many women quit the field and become moms instead."</p>
