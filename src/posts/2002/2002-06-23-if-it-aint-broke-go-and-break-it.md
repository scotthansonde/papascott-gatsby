<p>Just in time in summer patio season, I've manage to break my wireless connectivity. Well, at least my non-Windows wireless connectivity. Since running FreeBSD on my desktop machine has been going so well, I decided to put it on my ThinkPad 390X notebook as well. I wiped out the Debian partitions, not taking note of the wireless settings  it took me <a href="/2002/06/22">several days</a> to work out last summer.  After all, FreeBSD has wireless built in. That was on Thursday. I still haven't worked out how to get the wireless card going. According to ifconfig and wicontrol, everything should be set up properly, but when I ping, the connection lights sputter a couple of times instead of blinking madly as they should. Oh well, with Mozilla and putty under Win98 I can do most of what I need to do, and the sun is too bright to work outside anyway.</p>
