<p>Another note for Alwin, who <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/04/10#MzowOTo0OSBQTQdbdb">did a day of day care yesterday</a>. "...these kids were cared for an entire day by two experienced RNs with years of parenting experience. We could charge what it's worth, but who could afford to pay?"</p>
<p>Our "Tagesmütter" (translates as "day mother", the dry translation is "in-home day care provider") (there are also "Tagesväter" but they are rare...) has 20 years of professional experience, she teaches and certifies in-home day care providers, founded the state board and is on the national board of in-home day care, and is politically active on the national level on behalf of her profession. (And when she's out politicking, she arranges a substitute at no charge.) Her hourly rate is 25 cents per hour higher than average.</p>
<p>Just so you know what you could expect if you change professions :-)</p>
