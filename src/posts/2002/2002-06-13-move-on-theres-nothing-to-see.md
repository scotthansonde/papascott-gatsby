<p>A look at my referers show I'm being bombarded (well, nothing compared to <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/13.html#a6025">Jörg</a>) with hits from Google looking for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Death of a critic%22 Walser">"Death of a critic"+Walser</a>. Sorry, I don't really have anything more to say about it that I did <a href="/2002/05/31/index.php#001743">before</a>. And no, I don't know where you can download the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,200654,00.html">pirate version</a>. <b>Update:</b> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Maybe here?</span> Link removed. It seems linking to pdf/html manuscripts can be <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/14.html#a6048">expensive</a>!</p>
