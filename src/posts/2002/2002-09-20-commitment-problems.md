<p>The English version of the FAZ has a <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&doc={D78A3BF5-B1E7-47B6-B366-A49B3F95977D}">wrapup</a> of the campaign. I had to laugh out loud at this passage: "Stoiber's continued inability to coax the FDP into declaring its coalition preference before the election has left him at times looking like a suitor chasing a woman with commitment problems..." Comic relief is desparately needed at this stage.</p>
<p>Actually this <a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2002/09/16">story about chickens</a> reminded me a lot of politics. Especially the 'overestimating intelligence' part.</p>
