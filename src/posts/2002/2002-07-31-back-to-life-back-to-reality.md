<p>It took two months for Schröder to pull even with Stoiber in the polls. After the ousters of Telekom boss Sommer and Defence Minister Sharping, it took just a week to give it all back. <a href="http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/0,1872,2007711,FF.html">ZDF's Politbarometer</a> reported a 5% drop for the SPD in their biweekly poll, giving Union/FDP a majority if the election were held now. The SPD is responding by starting the 'hot phase' of the campaign next Monday, 3 weeks earlier than planned. Meanwhile, someone is releasing politicians' frequent flyer data to the Bild Zeitung. Funny, only politicians left of center are being outed. You don't suppose that it's a plot to help the Union? Nah......</p>
