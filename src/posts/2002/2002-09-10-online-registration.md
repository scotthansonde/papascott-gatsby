<p>So after almost 3 years, I resolved to finally get Christopher his US Passport, or at least get him registered at the American Consulate so he can get a SSN and vote and pay taxes and all that fun stuff. I had been putting it off until now at the high cost ($40 for registration + $40 dollars for passport, cash only, and if you don't pay in dollars you get a really bad exchange rate). Going to <a href="http://www.usembassy.de">http://www.usembassy.de</a>, I see 1) they've raised their prices to $65 / &euro; 78 (who does their banking?!?), 2) I have to get a special birth certificate for Christopher, and 3) they want a certified marriage certificate, which we no longer have since we submitted it when registered our marriage here. OK, I have to order some documents. <a href=""http://hamburg.de">http://hamburg.de lets you order birth certificates online without a credit card (long live COD!), if you can figure out which of the half-dozen offices in Hamburg is responsible for the location of the birth.  <a href="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us">http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us</a> does not offer marriage certificates online, but does offer a fax number for requests (have your credit card number handy!). However, once I get the paperwork together, I cannot complete Christopher's registration online or even by mail. That must be done in person at the consulate. I just love having to go through armed guards to do business with my government.</p>
