<p>The new <a href="http://www.sunlog.ch/_www/item00007.php">Sunlog 2.2 </a> is now ready for download. It's blogging software based on PHP and MySQL, and (as far as I know) is the first blogging package to support TrackBack after Movable Type. </p>
<p>Also, Daniel Fiene's <a href="http://www.blogstrasse.de/trackback/">uni.tb </a> (mentioned <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2002/07/06/1794.php">here</a> last week) is now available for download as a beta. It's a PHP function can integrate TrackBack into any blogging system than can output PHP. It's been tested with SunLog, pMachine and GreyMatter. At the moment, though, it's only documented in German.</p>
