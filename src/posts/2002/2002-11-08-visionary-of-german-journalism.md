Ruldof Augstein was founder of the news magazine Der Spiegel. As a journalist he not only reported on public life, he helped shape it. He spent over 3 months in jail in his battle with Franz-Josef Strauss and Konrad Adenauer over press freedom in the 'Spiegel Affair'. In the end he won, Strauss resigned, and Adenauer left office. He was an active member of the Free Democrats, and was even elected to the Bundestag in 1972, but stayed only 3 months. He was an active support of Willi Brandt's Ostpolitik, And he leaves behind a magazine that is both journalistically and financially sound.</p>
