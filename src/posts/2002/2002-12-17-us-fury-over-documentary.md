<p>Expatica: <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;item_id=27662">US fury over German Afghan documentary</a> "US officials expressed outrage Monday over the decision by a German television network to broadcast a documentary alleging that US troops stood idly by and allowed Northern Alliance troops to massacre Taliban soldiers last year in Afghanistan." The documentary by Irish filmmaker Jamie Doran is being shown on ARD tomorrow night. According to <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,227619,00.html">Spiegel Online</a>, the documentary has already aired in Britain and Italy, so it seems to be old news. So why does ARD deem it worthy of prime time? And why is the US State Dept complaining only now? Or did they protest the previous showings as well?</p>
