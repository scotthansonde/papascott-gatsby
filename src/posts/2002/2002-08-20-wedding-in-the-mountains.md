<p>Congratuations to <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/08/20">Andrea</a> and <a href="http://spicynoodles.org/2002/08/19">André</a>,  who have been <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/08/19">doing</a> more in <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020819">New Mexico</a> than just viewing the scenery. It looks like a much nicer looking place for a wedding than the typical German Standesamt.</p>
