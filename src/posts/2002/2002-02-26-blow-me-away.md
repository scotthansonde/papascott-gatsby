<p>I'm tired. It's blowing cats and dogs outside. And Mama's new office was delivered while we were at work, 14 heavy cartons to bring inside and upstairs.</p>
<p>Christopher's 'word' of the past few days is 'ohta' (or sometimes 'ohda'). He's saying it repeatedly. I keep asking, 'Who is ohta?' But he never answers.</p>
