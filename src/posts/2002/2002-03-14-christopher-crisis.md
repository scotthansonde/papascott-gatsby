<p>Strange, with Mozilla 0.9.9 I cannot flip my page... the http proxy says it cannot process my request.</p>
<p>The Christopher crisis yesterday had to do with the volume of liquids. He wanted to drink his apple juice from a bottle rather than a plastic cup, and was extremely upset that 0.3 l juice from the cup did not fit into the 0.25 l bottle. He wanted all the juice in the bottle and none in the cup. It took me 15 minutes to come up with the idea to let the bottle overflow (into a bowl), so that that bottle was full and the cup was empty.</p>
