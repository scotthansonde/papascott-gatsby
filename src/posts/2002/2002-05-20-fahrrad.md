He actually wanted me to show him <a href="http://www.airbus.com/products/t_spot_a330_340.asp">airplane pictures</a> on my laptop, but I was trying to read instead. I punched up the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$689">the best picture you ever took</a> (taken in the red light district in Amsterdam), and he immediately said "Fahrrad!" (German for bicycle). He knows what's really important! </p>
<p>Reply from Dave: Hehe. Smart kid. ;-></p>
