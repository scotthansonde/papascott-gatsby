<p>b2 includes a posting sidebar for Mozilla. It's handy for keeping windows open when typing a post. However, don't try switching to another sidebar when writing. I wanted to search Google for the last sentence of a post, hit the Search sidebar, and my post was gone. Oh well, it wasn't that good anyway. But it was better than this one.</p>
