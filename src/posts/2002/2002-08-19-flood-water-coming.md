<p>The flood waters from Dresden are heading north. Flooding is expected in the outskirts upstream of Hamburg by Thursday or Friday. However, Hamburg itself will be barely affected, since the harbor is large enough to disapate the flood. Our county (Landkreis Harburg) has declared an emergency for the Elbmarsch, where 12000 residents may have to be evacuated. The PapaScott residence is 50 km away from the area that might be flooded, so we are in no danger.</p>
