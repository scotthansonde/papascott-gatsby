<p>I've seen plenty of Linux magazines at gas stations and supermarkets, but when buying groceries this evening I saw <a href="http://www.php-mag.de/">PHP Magazin</a>. I picked it up, so I can now say that everything I know about computing I could have learned at the supermarket. Well, almost everything.</p>
