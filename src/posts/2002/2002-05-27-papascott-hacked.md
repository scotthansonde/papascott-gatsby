<p>If you use Movable Type, make sure you read <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2002_05_26.shtml#000297">this</a>, and double check that your mt-load.cgi has <i>really</i> been deleted. Even if you know you deleted it, double check... you might have inadvertantly copied it over when upgrading, like I did. I got hit. All my user ids were deleted, and I was unable to log in.</p>
