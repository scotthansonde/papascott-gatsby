<p>The Register: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/24652.html">AOL buys into homegrown media</a>. I work in the <a href="/2000/05/24">same</a> <a href="/2000/11/30">building</a> as <a href="http://www.aol.de">AOL Deutschland</a>, so I knew this was coming. And is why I'm no longer using <a href="http://www.userland.com">UserLand</a> software. I got out just in time.</p>
<p>AOL is not just after the content, they want the software behind it as well. Can you imagine <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a> on every AOL CD? And then all Radio users being required to use AOL to update their blogs? And that AOL is after <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> as well? Weblogs as AOL Premium Content, visible only to AOL subscribers?</p>
<p>It's a dark future we're looking at here.</p>
<p>And Happy April Fools Day.</p>
