<p>After a 2 week bus tour of Scandinavia, Christopher's grandparents are back with us for another week with their grandson. They were very happy with their return flight from London on <a href="">Ryan Air</a> for &pound;39 each (including taxes and fees), cheaper than the transfer from the hotel to Stansted airport. I'll be home this week to make the three don't cause too much trouble.</p>
