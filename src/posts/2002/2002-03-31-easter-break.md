<p>In the Easter spirit, we had Oma and Uncle Roland's family with Baby Lily over for coffee this afternoon. </p>
<p>Mama unfortunately has a stomach virus, and Christopher was still hyped up from last night's bonfire. They both are already in bed, whiile I fix things up here at the new weblog.</p>
