<p>Everyone's already pointing to the excellent series <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_weblog">30 days to a more accessible weblog</a> at <a href="http://diveintomark.org">dive into mark</a>. The examples <i>are</i> a bit contrived. For <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/11.html#day_2_michael">example</a>, I myself am color blind, and I do <i>not</i> see the world in shades of grey. Total color blindness, or <a href="http://www.achromat.org">Achromatopsia</a>, is rare. I just don't see green (an imaginary color that the rest of the world has made up to annoy me). I do, however, recognize all the colors on a traffic light. They are red, yellow, and white. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Mark's points are all valid. and yesterday's entry on  <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/08.html#day_21_ignoring_spacer_images">ignoring spacer images</a> was especially good. And since <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2002_07.shtml#000532">Movable Type will be adoping Mark's suggestions</a> in their templates, it won't be any work for me to incorporate them all. I just have to wait 9 more days.</p>
