<p>In the category 'things that are much more difficult than they seem', <a href="http://denbeste.nu/">USS Clueless</a> is now listed with a last-updated time in my blogroll. Actually, after I figured out how to extract the latest 'Stardate' from his main page, yesterday Steven started <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/11/NowwithRSS.shtml">posting</a> an RSS feed. So it's now fairly easy.</p>
