<p>Of all the blogs I read, I found only one mention of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/24/moscow.siege/index.html">siege at the Moscow theater</a>. It was Glenn Reynolds saying <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/004952.php#004952">this isn't getting the attention it deserves</a>, but not going any further. For what it's worth, the German media is giving it 10 times more attention than the arrest of Mr. Mohammed. This is Bali times 3 in slow motion, and none of the terrorism or Russia experts I saw had any hope of a peaceful solution. None.</p>
