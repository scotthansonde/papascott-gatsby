<p>BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2366917.stm">Moscow siege gas mystery unresolved</a>. The number of dead hostages seems to have stabilized at 117, but then it's still early in Moscow. When this started amd I was dreading the outcome, I was afraid that over a hundred hostages would die. In that sense my fears were realized. But this is still a good outcome. The Russians were right to do something rather than to do nothing. Those 'black widows' came to Moscow to die, but they never dreamed that they would die in their sleep.</p>
<p>Some are saying that <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/005044.php#005044">Putin was right</a>. As far as I know, Putin wasn't even consulted the morning of the raid. That might be because the decision to take action had already been taken the night before. But all I know is what I see in the news.</p>
