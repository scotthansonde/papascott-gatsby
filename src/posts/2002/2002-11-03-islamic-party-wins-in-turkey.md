<p>CNN.com: <a href="http://europe.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/11/03/turkey.elections/index.html">Islamic-roots party wins in Turkey</a> It's not surpising that the Islamic 'Justice and Development' party finished first, but it is a surprise that they will have an absolute majority in the Turkish parliament. We'll have to see what effect this has on the main foreign policy issues in Turkey, namely the application for EU membership, cooperation with the IMF, and cooperation with the US in possible military action against Iraq.</p>
