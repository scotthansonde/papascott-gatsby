<p><a href="http://www.expatica.com/germany.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;item_id=18466">DPA</a>: The German constitutional court has ruled that the Muslim practice of <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/halalb.htm">halal butchering</a> (using a knife without stunning) cannot be prohibited. The practice had been banned for animal protection reasons, although the similar practice of kosher butchering had been expressly allowed.</p>
