<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/02/09"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/shrekscott.jpg" height="68" width="50" border="0" alt="shrekscott.jpg: " align="left" /></a>I woke up this morning and feel pretty good. I haven't turned into a troll or an ogre, not yet. <b>Update</b> Hold on, I <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/02/09">have</a> turned into an ogre after all. Well, if I'm an ogre, that makes Christopher a donkey!</p>

The German white stocking caps with the long earlappers looked silly, I thought. The Olympics are crassly commercial and nationalistic, of course, but there are far worse ways to vent off such things. Like <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/02/08">Hal</a>, I enjoyed the oversized animal puppets. Seeing the US hockey team light the flame reminded me of February 1980, when they won the gold medal, and I had just started seeing a German exchange student in the next town.</p>
