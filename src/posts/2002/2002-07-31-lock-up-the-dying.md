<p>An executive manager and Bundestag candidate for the Schill party (founded and named after 'Judge Merciless', my favorite Hamburg Interior Senator) has issued <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;item_id=24453">call to lock up sick foreigners</a> who try to enter Germany, as a public health and anti-AIDS measure. The plan is being shot to pieces by all other parties, even by Schill's coalition partners in Hamburg. Senator Schill himself says that while the idea itself isn't bad, the use of the phrase 'detention camp' was unfortunate.</p>
