<p><a href="http://www.papascott.de">papascott.de</a>: <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2002/02/05/index.php#000127">Employment Referrals Aren't</a> German Employment Offices have apparently been faking their job placement statistics. Which means it's no wonder that unemployment here is still so high. And that this could be the scandal of the year, the German equivalent of Enron. Personally, if I were looking for a job, a German Employment Office would be the last place I'd check.</p>
