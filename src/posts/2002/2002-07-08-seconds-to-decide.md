<p>CNN.com on the mid-air collision over Lake Constance: <a href="http://europe.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/07/08/germany.crash/index.html">Pilot got conflicting warnings</a>. It seems there were a lot a problems at the privatized Swiss air traffic control <a href="http://www.skyguide.ch">Skyquide</a> that night. Phone lines down, collision control shut down for maintenance, back-up controller on break. The automatic on-board system worked. The human controller gave conflicting instructions. And the pilot had just seconds to decide what to do.</p>
