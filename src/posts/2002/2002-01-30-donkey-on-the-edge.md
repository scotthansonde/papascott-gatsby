<p>From the strange-taste-can-be-inherited department: Christopher just insisted on eating his cottage cheese with a dab of salsa. Just like his dad. Film at eleven.</p>
<p>This one is actually more  for <a href="http://www.curry.com">Adam Curry</a> than for me, but German TV Network ZDF has gotten lots of protests against <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,179523,00.html">the dress (or lack thereof</a>... in German, but pictures tell all) worn by singer Sarah Connor in last Saturday's Wetten Dass show. </p>
<p>New title line, see if it shows up on weblogs.com.</p>
<p>Update 2005: The Spiegel page is now pay-per-view, but pictures of Sarah Connor's wardrobe malfunction are also <a href="http://www.rp-online.de/public/bildershow_main/nachrichten/journal/gesellschaft/6287?picture_id=0">here</a>.</p>
