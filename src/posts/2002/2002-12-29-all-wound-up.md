<p>There's nothing like a 3-year-old with a birthday the same week as Christmas to keep things lively around the house between the holidays. And next year I'm sure that we will <em>not</em> invite the relatives to Christmas dinner and again two days later for birthday coffee and cake. It's like a bad case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</p>
<p>And on a completely unrelated note, I hate editing style sheets as well. After unsuccessfully trying to adapt the BlueRobot style from b2, I gave up and dug out my old MT style sheet from September.</p>
