<p>Weekly Standard (via <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/week_2002_08_11.php#002940">InstaPundit</a>): <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/543yatms.asp">Ich Bin Ein Slacker</a>. Right facts, wrong conclusion. The reason service is so bad in restaurants (and shops) in Germany is not the 'demise of the German work ethic'. As far as I know, German service has <i>never</i> been good. Restaurants and shops are chronically short staffed, and customers are seen by employees as an annoyance. But this is hardly news.</p>
<p>And, at least in Niedersachsen, we <i>can</i> rent videos on Sundays.</p>
