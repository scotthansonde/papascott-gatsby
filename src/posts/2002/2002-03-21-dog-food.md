<p><a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">Moveable Type 2.0</a> has been released. Time to update <a href="http://www.papascott.de">papascott.de</a> and start posting there again. I'd also like to somehow convert the happy-stripe design here to a CSS design for MT. Good thing the Easter holidays are coming up.</p>
<p>I've stayed in FreeBSD since Monday. My system is usable, but not yet complete. My problems so far have been the java plugin for Mozilla (crashes on the Domino mail applet) and finding a Citrix client (Linux version runs under emulation, but doesn't encrypt so I can't log in).</p>
