<p><a href="http://davespicks.com/archive/2002/0514.html">Dave's Picks</a> says that although I may feel less safe in Europe now, he felt a whole lot unsafer when visiting behind the Iron Curtain, back when there was a Iron Curtain. </p>
<p>If I can count days correcty, we must have been in Phoenix the same time as <a href="http://booknotes.weblogs.com/2002/05/14">Craig</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still bouncing my workstation back and forth between <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> Linux and <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>. I can't run <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo">komodo</a> under FreeBSD, but there's no <a href="http://www.kde.org">kde3</a> ready for Debian yet. </p>
<p>Today was my first day back at the office. QM is complaining that their Mac (a 3-1/2 year old G3)  is too slow to test anything on, so maybe we'll be getting a nice G4 with OSX after all. But I doubt if we Unix bigots will ever let a <a href="http://www.apple.com/xserve/">Xserve</a> in our server room.</p>
