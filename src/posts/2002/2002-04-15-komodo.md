<p>We seem to already be in vacation mode, although we don't leave until Saturday.  It's not hard when it's 10&deg;C and rainy here, while it's 35&deg;C in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>I've been trying out <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">ActiveState Komodo</a>, an IDE/debugger for Perl and PHP, among others.  (For my non-programming family and friends, it's an editor for writing programs that can also help find mistakes.) I found it helpful yesterday afternoon when I was alone with Christopher, since I was able to easily find my place after the frequent interruptions.</p>
