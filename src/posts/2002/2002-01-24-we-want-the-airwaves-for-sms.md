<p>A couple days late again. Deutsche Telekom announced over the weekend they would be doubling (to 40 cents)  the price of sending SMS messages for new customers, then withdrew the plans Monday after a huge media and political backlash. The mean old magenta T would be taking advantage of all those teenagers. As if the cell providers don't already... one radio report mentioned offhand that SMS generates one-third of income from cellular networks.</p>
