<p>Some people get quite passionate about RSS. I don't, I just want to provide usable feeds. The b2 upgrade produces 3 flavors of RSS, and thanks to mod_rewrite I can now direct all old links to the new files. Meanwhile, Horst Prillinger (who for all I know, <a href="http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/2002/11/08.html#a692">might not even be a man</a>), will be happy to know that the feeds <a href="http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/2002/10/30.html#a621">no longer include raw URLs</a>, which apparently Radio Userland does not handle gracefully.</p>
<p>In other news, Pete Prodoehl has produced <a href="http://zymm.com/raster/code/amphetaskin.html">a nice template, er skin</a> for <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>. My main wish for AmphetaDesk would be to tell it not to include images. The secret is probably in the template code.</p>
