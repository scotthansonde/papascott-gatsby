<p>15 minutes until I have to wake up Christopher... You know the world has changed when I start mostly agreeing with American hawks. But the idea of moving US bases away from Germany (brought up in the <a hrf="http://www.papascott.de/2002/09/24/1903.php#001903">discussion here</a> and by <a href="http://catotheyoungest.blogspot.com/">Cato the Youngest</a>) on second thought doesn't sound that bad to me. Not to punish Germany, because it wouldn't be much of a punishment, and would cost the US most than it would hurt the Germans. It <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/09/EUforceprojection.shtml">wouldn't force the Germans to increase defence spending</a>, and not would hurt the German economy in any noticable way (some communities in SW Germany would hurt, but they all voted for Stoiber anyway, so it's no skin off Schröder's nose). But it'd be a sure sign that the world has changed, and that the Americans don't need to protect anyone from the Germans anymore. OK... time to play alarm clock!</p>
