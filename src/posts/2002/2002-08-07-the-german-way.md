<p>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/06/international/europe/06GERM.html?ex=1029297600&amp;en=ed57c9f323153bdb&amp;ei=5040&amp;partner=MOREOVER">Trailing in Polls, German Leader Tries Early Start in Race</a>.  And he's brought up Iraq as a campaign issue, with some latent anti-Americanism to boot.  "We are ready for solidarity, but this land will not be prepared for adventures... I'm not for playing around with war or military action." He's calling this the "German way". No more European way? I seem to remember the last time Germany went its own way, it prematurely recognized the statehood of Croatia and accelerated the breakdown and chaos in Yugoslavia.</p>
