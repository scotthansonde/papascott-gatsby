<p>It's the day after, and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/">Spiegel Online</a> is full of resignations. Möllemann resigns from his national FDP party offices (but not as chairman in NRW). Däubler-Gmelin announces she won't be available for the new cabinet (as if Schröder was going to ask). And Merz is making way for Merkel to be Bundestag minority leader. The teams might be the same, but you're going to have to buy a new program to tell the players.</p>
