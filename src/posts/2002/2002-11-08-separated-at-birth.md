<p>In looking for something else at Google news, I ran into this article at <a href="http://www.theglobalist.com">The Globalist</a> claiming that <a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=2834">Schröder and Bush are Political Brothers in Arms</a>, and that Bush could end up with as big a post-election hangover as Schröder has. It also claims that Daschle and Stoiber both lost for the same reason.</p>
