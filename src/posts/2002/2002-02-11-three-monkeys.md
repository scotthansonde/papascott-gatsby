<p>All three crises are still bubbling.<br />
The number of informants in the <b>NPD scandal</b> is up to 5, maybe 6, and there are more and more calls from FDP and CDU to drop the case.<br />
Meanwhile, in the <b>job placement scandal</b>, reports are that Arbeitsamt head Jagoda was informed of irregularites 4 years ago, and other reports that he ordered his investigators to refute the current charges, rather than to see if they were true.  He's not a political appointee, but he's probably on the way out.<br />
And in Brussels, Schröder may have avoided a formal <b>EU budget warning</b>, but at the cost of a lot of bad blood in the Commission and the smaller member countries.<br />
I can't remember that Kohl ever had to juggle 3 crises at once. Hell, Kohl couldn't juggle at all.</p>
