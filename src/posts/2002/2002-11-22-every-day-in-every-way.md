<p>Sorry, I've been paying more attention to my blogroll than to my blog today. I'll post details later, but just note that the blogroll now combines update data from both blo.gs and blogrollings, as well as HTTP headers for a few selected sites. So there are just two sites left for which I don't have update times. But they, too, will fall.</p>
