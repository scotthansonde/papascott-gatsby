<p>I'm getting a project ready at work, and the little guy demands his share of attention at home. I won't have a lot time free time this week.</p>
<p>I've beem playing a little bit with running <a href="http://inessential.com/linux/frontierUnderWine">Frontier under Wine</a> with Debian Linux. It seems to run more stable for me than for Brent Simmons. I suspect that the Debian Wine package is compiled differently than his Wine binaries.</p>
