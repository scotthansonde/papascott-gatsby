<p>Mama hasn't written anything for PapaScott yet, but she has been busy taking pictures for <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=185392">PhotoPoint</a>. We made it easier for her to send pictures there by putting the account in her name. She can now send the pictures in via E-mail direct from the camera, and PhotoPoint automatically resizes the files. It wastes lots of bandwidth, but is much easier to work with.</p>
<p>Christopher is now bending his knees when he lays on his stomach. He just has to get his butt a little higher, and he'll be crawling!</p>
