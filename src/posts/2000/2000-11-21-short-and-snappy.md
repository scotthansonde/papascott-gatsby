<p>Sunny and cool today. </p>
<p>Another home office day. I'm getting more accomplished than I thought I would. My boss will be happy. :-)</p>
<p>Since there is not Linux Notes client, we use <a href="http://www.citrix.com">Citrix Metaframe</a> to access Notes on NT. It even works at home, tunneling through ssh over the Internet.</p>
<p>Up to now, the main drawback of Metaframe was having only 256 colors. But now they have a new client that allows up to 16 million.</p>
<p>Good thing I read weblogs. Then I don't need a calendar. Thanks to <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Andrea</a>, I realized Thanksgiving is this week and not next (we don't have any US calendars around the house), and thanks to <a href="http://www.vfth.com">Al</a>, I remembered to pick up some new Beaujolais Primeuer from the <a href="http://www.aldi.de">gourmet store</a>.</p>
