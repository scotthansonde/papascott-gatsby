<p>A big load off my shoulders today... the new company website is online, nearly two months late and just two working days before we fly to the US! I would have preferred that it be up running for a month before skipping off, but 48 hours is a good burn-in time, right?</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mama's done the lion's share of planning and preparation for our trip. We've done plenty o trips between Europe and the US, but adding Christopher to the equation will make things roughly twice as complicated, I'm guessing.</p>
<p>We fly first to Phoenix for a week, then to Minnesota for 2 weeks. We'll be visiting friends and family... no time to play tourist!</p>
