<p>I hope either McCain or Bradley stays in the race. I have to pay big bucks for postage to send in an absentee ballot, but Gore vs Bush is not worth the bother of licking the stamp.</p>
<p>We had a tough weekend. Our neighbor Walter turned 70 on Saturday, with dinner and coffee starting at 11 am at the fire hall in Lüllau. And the schnaps started flowing before noon. Then on Sunday we had a combined February birthday for me, Mama's brother and his 5-year-old daughter. Highlight was hearing her sing along to the new <a href="http://www.tomjones.com">Tom Jones</a> single: <a href="http://www.v2music.com/Scripts/WebObjects-ISAPI.dll/V2_New_Publisher.woa/74892000002661200000629520000025733/TomJonesReleaseIndex.wo/018020000006733/0.3.0/1/Webobjects1">Sex Bomb</a>!</p>
<p>Christopher came through the weekend in much better shape than Mama and I!</p>
