<p>Christopher seems to enjoy 'dancing' (which at his age means being held by an adult who is dancing) to music on the radio. Today we overcame a small crying phase with help of <a href="http://www.thecorrs.org/disco/lyrics/lyrics_a.html#ays">The Corrs</a>.</p>
<p>He also likes the classic 'Surfin' Bird' because he can sing along. 'Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa Mow-mow, papa-ooma-mow-mow!'</p>
