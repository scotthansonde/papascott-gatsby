<p>After complaints from the grandparents, we finally have some new picutures at <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=6807392">PhotoPoint</a></p>
<p><b>Euro 2000</b> The big news first: England 1 Germany 0. The game was fair, hard-fought, entertaining, and could have gone either way, but only confirmed what should have been already clear: neither team is in the top class of European soccer. </p>
<p>The last time England defeated Germany in a tournament was in 1966, the famous World Cup final at Wembley, and the goal that never crossed the line but counted anyway. Germans still remember that.</p>
<p>CNNSI.com: <a href="http://cnnsi.com/soccer/world/2000/euro2000/news/2000/06/17/england_germany_ap/">England tops Germany 1-0</a> </p>
<p>Portugal 1 Romania 0. The goal came on a free kick seconds before the final whistle. Until then Portugal had been totally frustrated by the Romanian defense.</p>
<p>Standings: Portugal 6 pts, England 3 pts, Germany and Romania 1 pt.</p>
<p>On Friday: France 2 Czech Rep 0, Netherlands 3 Denmark 0. These 4 teams would have been a fair set of semi-finalists. </p>
<p>Standings France and Netherlands 6 pts, Czech Rep and Denmark 0 pts.</p>
