<p>A couple of days ago <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/10/28">Sheila</a> had a link to a CNN story about Halloween in France. Here in Germany, trick-or-treaters rang over a dozen times at Mama's brother's place in Holm-Seppensen. And Hamburg is full of posters for Halloween M&Ms. Can it be a coincidence?</p>
<p><a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$426?mode=day">Andrea wrote in</a> that she'd never heard of of German kids celebrating Halloween before. I have a feeling that somehow kids in Holm-Seppensen learned about Halloween in school, and decided to try it out to see if they could really get candy.</p>
