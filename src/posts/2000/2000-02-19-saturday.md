<p>CNNSI: <a href="http://cnnsi.com/soccer/world/news/2000/02/18/german_roundup_ap/">Berlin tops Hamburg</a> Berlin snaps Hamburg SV's seven-game unbeaten streak, but HSV will stay in 3rd place. 2nd place Leverkusen tied at Schalke. <i>I'm a fair weather HSV fan. If they were losing, as usual, I wouldn't be mentioning it.</i></p>
