<p>Ooops... the blue shoes give him away. ";->" This picture was taken 2 weeks ago on my uncle's farm in Minnesota. Christopher usually chews on dead leaves when he finds them in the house, but outside I guess there were so many that he couldn't decide which one to put in his mouth.</p>
<p>He seems to be completely over his illness. He's on antibiotics and a mucous-loosener for the rest of the week, and no cold drafts or groups of children until the week is over. We'll check in with the pediatrician on Wednesday. </p>

<p>This is how he looks today from way too close.</p>
