<p>It looks like we've survived the big four... Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and Christopher's Birthday. </p>
<p>And we had a white Christmas. We got about 5 inches on Christmas Eve, and it's still on the ground. According to the <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de">Abendblatt</a>, it was the most snow since 1960. It was a strange storm. It snowed only on the edge of a front, in a band about 40 km wide. We got snow, "andrea"'s parents 50 km west of us got snow, but Hamburg 20 km north of us just got rain.</p>
<p>The bad news is... the dishwasher has given up its ghost. The water pump is burned out, and not worth fixing. A new diswasher has a delivery time of 8 weeks. The good news is... we ordered a new dishwasher 8 weeks ago. ";->"</p>
