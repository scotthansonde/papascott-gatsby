<p><b>Euro 2000 update</b> Group B: Italy 2 Belgium 0, Turkey 0 Sweden 0.<br />
Standings: Italy 6 pts, Belgium 3 pts, Turkey and Sweden 1 pt.<br />
Italy was solid but boring against co-host Belgium. Turkey and Sweden were both equally bad and boring... an utter waste of time.</p>
<p><b>Carrot update</b> Christopher finished the glass he started on <a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com/2000/06/13">Monday</a>. Carpet and walls in the dining root are still intact. Next week we'll try potatoes.</p>
