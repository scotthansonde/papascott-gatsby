<p>Brent and Sheila may have the Mariners, but we're just down the road from the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Sideline/4800/">Dohren Wild Farmers</a></p>
<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/">Andrea</a>:  "Panama makes me think of <a href="http://titan.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~schumach/pages/janosch.html">Janosch</a>." We have a Janosch calender in Christopher's (future) room. I'd never heard of Janosch before coming here, though. </p>
<p>Both Mama and I have some learning to about children's books from the other's country. We're trying to already estalish a going-to-bed routine for Christopher with 15 minutes of reading. Yesterday Mama tried reading English nursery rhymes... but, of course, they're all new to her, and she doesn't know the tunes. (This evening I cheated... I read Christopher a chapter from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dbnation/">Database Nation</a>.)</p>
