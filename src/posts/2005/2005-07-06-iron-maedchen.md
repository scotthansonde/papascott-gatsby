<p><a href="http://fistfulofeuros.net/archives/001654.php" title="A Fistful of Euros: Two peoples divided by a common language">Mrs. T at AFOE</a> points to a <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2122001/" title="Deutschland's Iron Lady - Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher? By Clay Risen">profile of Angela Merkel at Slate</a> that Wahlbloggers in Germany might find interesting. The comparisons to Thatcher  are inevitable, and reflect wishful thinking by US conservatives that Merkel is somehow like them (she's not). There are some minor mistakes; for example a M&auml;dchen is no "Lady". And don't get tripped up when it says the CSU is "economically liberal"; that's an Americanism and means the opposite of what you think it does.</p>
