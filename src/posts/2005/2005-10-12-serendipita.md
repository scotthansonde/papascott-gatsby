<p>I'm a little slow on the uptake, but I just <a href="http://serendipita.org/2005/09/21/hello-world/" title="Serendipita » Hello World!">noticed</a> that Andrea's Weblog is now <a href="http://serendipita.org/" title="Serendipita">Serendipita</a> with her own domain. It's the oldest continuously running German weblog. And funny how most of us <a href="http://serendipita.org/2005/09/24/shout-out/">editthispage.com veterans are now on WordPress</a>. We've all been blogging so long, shouldn't we all be rich by now?</p>
<p>Update: Er, <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/12/serendipita/#comment-2098">I mean second oldest</a>.</p>
