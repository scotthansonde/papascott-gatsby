<p>We don't seem to have made an official announcement, but I can say that the 'back soon' sign at <a href="http://blogstats.de/">blogstats.de</a> is <em>not</em> a message of disaster or impending doom. We reorganized the database, and it took longer than we thought. The database is done, the code just has to be adjusted, and I'm sure the blogstats site will be back up first thing in the morning, if not sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Well, obviously it's taking the coders longer than we thought to adapt to the new database setup. Data is being collected, we use the same data source at <a href="http://blogg.de/">blogg.de</a>, and I'm sure (I hope) blogstats will be back up shortly. <strong>Update 2:</strong> Just as I posted the update, the page was reactivated. Well, mostly.</p>
