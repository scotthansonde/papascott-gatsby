<p>The funny thing about my previous employer going bankrupt is that for January we will get paid on time for the first time in months. The government guarantees three months pay in event of insolvency, so it is routine for the court-appointed administrator to get a bank credit for paying salaries. </p>
<p>The not-so-funny thing is that the bankruptcy process has delayed my departure, as releases from employment contracts need to be approved by the administrator, and he wasn't signing any releases at first. He's now releasing people not going to the competition, so I should be clear now. My boss and I have agreed on a release date of mid February.</p>
<p>The good news for my co-workers is that the administrator is confident that a serious buyer will be found, one interested in keeping the present customers, projects and developers. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, at my new job <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1220">Nico has my new office ready</a> :-).</p>
