<p>I'm not sure how well this is known outside Germany, but the number one beer sold in Germany is no longer a national premium brand like Warsteiner, Bitburger or Krombacher, but the discount brand <a href="http://www.oettinger-bier.de/">Oettinger</a>. Spiegel Online calls it <a title="Brauereien: Ein Bier f&uuml;r Hartz IV" href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,348108,00.html"><em>Ein Bier f&uuml;r Hartz IV</em></a>, after Schr&ouml;der's social reform package, since Oettinger usually sells at half the price of national brands. They cut costs by not advertising, selling only in stores (no bars or restaurants), and distributing themselves instead of through wholesalers. Interestingly, it's not sold at discount chains like Aldi... the profit margin there is too low.</p>
