<p>In Germany politics, it almost seems that nothing happens without first being approved in advanced by a party committee, and it's almost a relief when something spontaneous and unexpected occurs. The <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/02/21/schleswigholstein-counts-the-votes/" title="PapaScott: Schleswig-Holstein Counts the Votes">minority Red-Green government in Schleswig-Holstein</a> was signed, sealed, but in the end not delivered. One member of the supposed coalition abstained in four secret ballots, und thus <a href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=26&story_id=18197" title="Expatica - Schleswig-Holstein premier<br />
quits after Kiel vote debacle">Premier Heidi Simonis fell one vote short</a>  of forming a government and subsequently resigned after nearly 12 years in office. </p>
<p>Schleswig-Holstein is a small fish in national politics, but symbolically this is a huge blow for Chancellor Schr&ouml;der and the SPD. If you can't get your own back-benchers to support a long-standing state premier, how can you be expected to run the largest country in the EU? And how can you expect to keep ruling Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany's largest and last remaining Red-Green state which holds elections in May (the polls are neck and neck).</p>
<p>Simonis, Germany's first and only female premier, always spoke her mind and I'll miss her for that (and her hats). Maybe Schr&ouml;der will find a place for her in his Home for Wayward SPD Premiers (er, I mean his cabinet).</p>
