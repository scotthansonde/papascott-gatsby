<p><a href="http://www.welt.de/">Die Welt</a> is a year late and a few Euros short. Just today they report that <a href="http://www.welt.de/data/2005/06/18/733179.html" title="Um Kopf und Kragen geplaudert">revealing details about work in your blog</a> can cost you your job. Doh! Revealing them by cellphone or e-mail can be equally dangerous, better stay away from them too! Fortunately my boss <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1767" title="Blog killt Karriere? [Lummaland - das Weblog]">Nico doesn't feel that way</a>. We don't have a formal <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/02/11/blogging-policy/" title="PapaScott: Blogging Policy">blogging policy</a>, but as long as I don't openly criticize his <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1769" title="Doenerstag [Lummaland - das Weblog]">D&ouml;ner pictures</a>, I think I'm OK.</p>
