<p>I was reminded of PapaScott's <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/05/">6th anniversary</a> (and indeed that of all early adopters of editthispage.com) not by <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/2005/12/06/6-year-blogiversary/">Susan's post</a>, but by a couple of <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/05/cats-in-sinks/#comment-2188" title="PapaScott &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Cats in Sinks">strange comments</a> that got past my spam filter. They came at the same time, from different IP addresses, were posted to a throw-away entry, seem to be written by the same person, look like spam, but were aware that PapaScott was 6 years old that day. Color me puzzled and bemused, and thank you, I think. And <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/05/editthispage-again/">congratulations</a> to ETP veterans everywhere! We're still not <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/12/serendipita/">rich</a>, but maybe we can forge an entry on Wikipedia giving us credit for this weblog thing.</p>
