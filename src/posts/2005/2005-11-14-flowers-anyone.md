<p>I shouldn't try to read before I've had my coffee. I see that <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2262" title="ftd.de bloggt auch, bald, Montag [Lummaland - das Weblog]">FTD is to start blogging</a>, and I wonder what blogging has to do with <a href="http://www.ftd.com/home/" title="FTD.COM - Send flowers and gifts delivered fresh from florists">flowers</a>. But wait, of course, <a href="http://www.ftd.de/" title="FINANCIAL TIMES DEUTSCHLAND">ftd.de</a> is something completely different, the Finanacial Times Deutschland, and has nothing to do with cheesey TV ads with Merlin Olsen.</p>
