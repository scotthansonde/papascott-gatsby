<p>New West has a <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/546" title="New West Network | Part 1: Inside the World of the 'Dasen Girls'">bizarre 6 part story of prostitution and methamphetamines in rural Montana</a>. I've heard of meth labs near my old home town in Minnesota, but meth is a rural phenomenon that began after I left, so the disruption and destruction that meth addiction can cause in small towns was new to me, especially when the economy is failing. In this particular story a local businessman is taking advantage of young women who need money for the drug. After a woman is killed in a car accident, her mother had the courage to gather evidence and go to the police. <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/04/methamphetamine_wreckage_in_montana.php" title="Mark A.
