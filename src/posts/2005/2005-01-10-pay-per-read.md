<p>So I read that Adam Kalsey is <a title="Stupid cell phone tricks :: Adam Kalsey" href="http://kalsey.com/blog/2005/01/stupid_cell_phone_tricks/index.html">sending SMS by e-mail</a> for a project, and I wonder... well, first why doesn't Adam just get a GSM modem... but then, why do the carriers allow that, don't they miss out on the revenue? But of course, this is America, where the cell phone business is backwards and <a title="Russell Beattie Notebook - 2.5 Billion Ways to Screw the American Mobile Consumer" href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008232.html">both sender and <em>recipient</em></a> pay for SMS, and since text messesging is now taking off in the States, the first kids are getting horrendous bills. So never mind.</p>
