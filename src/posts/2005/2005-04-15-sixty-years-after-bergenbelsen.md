<p><a href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2005/04/this_day_in_his.html">David's Medienkritik</a> reminded me that this is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of <a href="http://www.bergen-belsen.de/en/">Bergen-Belsen</a>, located about 50 km from our house. I've <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/04/11/explaining-the-unexplainable/" title="PapaScott: Explaining the Unexplainable">mentioned before</a> that Bergen-Belsen is perhaps the eeriest place I've ever been. There are no original buildings from the camp. They were all burned, and there are no replicas. There is a small museum, and various memorials, but most of the grounds consist of heather-covered mounds. Dozens of mounds. Each is a mass grave representing thousands of dead.  The stillness is overwhelming.</p>
