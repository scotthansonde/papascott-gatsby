<p><a title="powerbook _ blog" href="http://powerbook.blogger.de/">powerbook_blog</a>, who normally blogs almost exclusively about his (surprise) Powerbook, <a href="http://powerbook.blogger.de/stories/277548/" title="powerbook _ blog: [blog]impact NRW Wahl - der Tag danach">makes the observation</a> that the NRW elections and Schr&ouml;der's decision to call new elections could be the best thing to ever happen to the German blogosphere. I paraphrase: "In my 1 year blogging career I've never seen so many political blog postings. I would find it almost revolutionary if this would continue. It would be fantistic if we could get a little bit away from our we-can't-do-anything-about-it-anyway mentality and blog a little bit about politics."</p>
<p>What, a revolution? In Germany? Nah, it will never happen...</p>
