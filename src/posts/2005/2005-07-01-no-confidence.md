<p>I watched the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4639781.stm" title="BBC NEWS | Europe | Germany heads for early elections">confidence vote in the Bundestag</a> this morning, hoping to watch a historical event. I haven't watched a government slowly disintegrate since Nixon resigned, and this being Germany the unraveling of the Red/Green coalition is taking place in painfully slow motion. But the debate and the vote were short and disappointing. It was almost like business as usual, and it had the feel of a planned and staged event. Probably because it was, except for <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,363215,00.html" title="Historische Bundestagssitzung: Aggressiver Wahlkampfauftakt am V-Tag - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten">Werner Schulz's speech</a> describing the process as the farce that it was.</p>
