<p>Assigning meaningful yet witty hostnames is an important task for every systems administrator.</p>
<p>When I recently took over a pair of webservers named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Muntz">nelson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse">milhouse</a>, I immediately thought of Watergate-era US politicians, since I knew my new boss had studied politics at Berkeley. Only later did I realize that it was actually Matt Groening who was thinking of politicans when he was naming characters for The Simpsons. (The companion servers itchy and scratchy should have been a dead giveaway.)</p>
<p>Too bad, since the firewalls protecting nelson and milhouse would have been perfectly named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_Seven">haldeman and erlichman</a>. haldeman in front, he's the heavy.</p>
