<p>The other shoe has finally dropped. My present employer, the Netlife AG, <a title="heise online - Netlife AG stellt Antrag auf Insolvenzverfahren" href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/55369">today declared bankruptcy</a>. The unknown investor who was to save the company in reduced form apparently backed out. </p>
<p>Salaries have been paid out in full through December, so noone is waiting on back pay. We'll have to apply to the <em>Arbeitsamt</em> for <em>Insolvenzgeld</em> to cover our January salaries, and after that I'll be gone. Most of my fellow admins have landed on their feet elsewhere, and none of us are shedding any tears.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just to make it clear, this is my old job where I was down to half-time and had already resigned. My <a href="http://www.nu2m.de/">new job</a> (nothing to see there yet, but one thing they do is <a href="http://www.blogg.de/">blogg.de</a>) begins on 1 February.</p>
