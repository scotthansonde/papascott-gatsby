<p>Anyone who ever saw a Twins baseball game in Minnesota would recognize the voice of Bob Casey, the Twins PA announcer since before I was born, who turned a no smoking announcement into a work of art, and bellowed the name of every player, home or visitor, as if he were a superstar (even if he <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5315530.html">got some of the names wrong</a>). He <a title="Yahoo! Sports - MLB - Longtime Minnesota Twins PA announcer Bob Casey dies" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-obit-twinspaannouncer&prov=ap&type=lgns">died on Saturday</a> at age 79. </p>
<p>"The totals on the board are correct" is what he said immediately after the final out, <a title="Patrick Reusse: No joy in baseball now that Casey's gone" href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/508/5315506.html">even when they weren't</a>. It's hard to imagine what a Twins game will be like without him. <a href="http://davespicks.com/archive/2005/03/28.html">(Dave's Picks)</a></p>
