<p><a title="ChicagoKarl - Spießer" href="http://chicagokarl.de/2005/05/17/spie%c3%9fer">ChicagoKarl</a> points out an article at FAZ that tries to explain in English the German concept of a <a title="Spießer - FAZ.NET - FAZ Weekly" href="http://www.faz.net/s/Rub9E75B460C0744F8695B3E0BE5A30A620/Doc~E56CBCF40E40C4111B907FE54D437615F~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html"><em>Spießer</em></a>, which can't really be explained. <a title="LEO Ergebnisse für 'spießer'" href="http://dict.leo.org/?lp=ende&lang=de&searchLoc=0&cmpType=relaxed&relink=on&sectHdr=on&spellToler=std&search=spie%DFer">LEO</a>  says it's "bourgeois" or "square", but that doesn't really cut it. It's more of a middle-class, middle-aged conformist. You could also say suburban, except Germany doesn't have suburbs. </p>
<p>My personal definition is "that what we once ridiculed, but what we have now become", which I usually think of when I'm mowing the lawn, even though I'm allergic to grass clippings and don't really care how the lawn looks.</p>
