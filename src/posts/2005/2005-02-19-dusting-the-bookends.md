<p>Funny, ever since I went to work for a blogging company, I don't really have time to pay attention to my own blog. But I did some tweaking today. I put in new <a href="http://www.twin-music.com/azlyrics/g_file/songs/gogo/head.html">song lyrics</a> in the header, and put back the  <a title="PapaScott: Heros without Glory" href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/18/heros-without-glory/">photo of the DDR uprising girl</a>. And I adjusted the blogroll to show only a random category instead of the whole thing, plus the expat weblogs (since that's probably the most unique group I belong to). Randomizing the blogroll will probably mess with <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati's</a> mind when counting my outgoing links, though. We'll see.</p>
