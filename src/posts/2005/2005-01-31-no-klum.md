<p>My wife has the chance to meet supermodel <a title="Heidi Klum GmbH" href="http://www.heidiklum.com/">Heidi Klum</a>, but she's turning it down. It's not just that she doesn't think she is an appropriate spokesperson for her business or that she seems to be "just as blond as she looks". It's mostly because her male colleagues can't think straight anymore because their tongues are hanging out at the prospect of meeting a real, live supermodel.</p>
<p>If you care to meet Heidi Klum, she'll be doing promotion at the<br />
<a title="Hamburger Morgenpost" href="http://tinyurl.com/3k3wr">Hamburg ZOB</a> (central bus station) next Wednesday. But don't expect to get real close.</p>
