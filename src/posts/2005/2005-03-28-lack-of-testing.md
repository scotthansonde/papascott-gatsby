<p><a title="Hack the Planet: Sunday, March 27, 2005" href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/2005/03/27">Hack the Planet</a> on Autopackage: </p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not sold on the <a href="http://www.autopackage.org/">Autopackage</a> system, but I agree with their analysis of the problems with <a href="http://bylands.dur.ac.uk/%7Emh/autopackage.org/faq.html#2_1">kitchen-sink Linux distributions</a> and <a href="http://bylands.dur.ac.uk/%7Emh/autopackage.org/faq.html#4_1">extreme software modularity</a>.<br />
One issue that is not mentioned is that Autopackage encourages<br />
installation of untested configurations; this is not too surprising<br />
given that everybody else does, too, and the open source world has<br />
largely abandoned testing anyway.</p></blockquote>
