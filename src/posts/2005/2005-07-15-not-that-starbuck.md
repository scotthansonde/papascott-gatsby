<p>We'll be flying to Minnesota next week and spending two weeks on Lake Minnewaska at my parents' lake house near <a href="http://www.starbuckmn.org/" title="Starbuck Minnesota USA - City and Chamber of Commerce">Starbuck</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">coffee shop chain</a>). I just realized that they no longer have a telephone at the lake, since they have a cell phone. And I doubt that Starbuck (without the final s) has WiFi. I guess that means that posting to PapaScott will be fairly light while we are there. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we won't be getting any pesky emails from our respective employers.</p>
