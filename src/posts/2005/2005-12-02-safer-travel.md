<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,69712,00.html">Bruce Schneier on airport security</a>. "Exactly two things have made airline travel safer since 9/11: reinforcement of cockpit doors, and passengers who now know that they may have to fight back. Everything else...is security theater." (quote lifted from <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/05/12/9941.html">kottke.org</a>)</p>
