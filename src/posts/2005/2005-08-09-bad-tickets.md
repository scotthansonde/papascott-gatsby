<p>My wife's company has been sponsoring the <a href="http://www.hsv.de/">local soccer team</a> for I don't know how many years now, and today for the first time she brought home match tickets. But somehow I don't think the tickets are very good. </p>
<p>For one thing, the match is against <a href="http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/de/index.php" title="FC Bayern M&uuml;nchen">Bayern M&uuml;nchen</a>, a team they haven't beaten in years and a match they are sure to lose. </p>
<p>And for another thing, the <a href="http://www.hsv.de/index.php?id=8817" title="Hamburger SV: Business-Seats West">seats are behind glass</a> and pretty far from the playing field. I'm sure we won't be able to <a href="http://www.hsv.de/index.php?id=12814">see or hear well</a> at all.</p>
<p>Well, the tickets didn't cost us anything, so I guess we should be happy that we'll be going to a game at all. At least they are for a league match and not for some <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/">meaningless international tournament</a>.</p>
