<p>We spent a couple of nice hours this sunny afternoon with <a href="http://www.jinglelady.us/" title="Adventures of an American Girl in Germany">Anna</a>, who was in Hamburg for the weekend. Christopher enjoyed showing her the harbor on the <a href="http://www.louisiana-company.de/">Louisiana Star</a> (which Christopher has <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/02/22/mr-christopher-goes-to-town/">ridden before</a>), and the old Elbe tunnel. Anna's leaving Germany in a month for her <a href="http://www.haughty.us/blog/">fianc&eacute;</a> in Texas, so she's doing a lot of sightseeing in the few weeks before she leaves.</p>
<p>I realized after we parted ways that we didn't take any pictures of one another, so you'll just have to take our words for it that we had a good time. We still have no idea, though, why there is a Southern-style riverboat in Germany.</p>
