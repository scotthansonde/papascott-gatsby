<p>I don't see it anywhere on their websites, but today all offices of the McDonald's Corporation are closed in remembrance of former CEO <a title="01/16/05 - McDonald's Former President and CEO Charlie Bell Dies of Cancer" href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/corp/news/corppr/cpr_01162005.html">Charlie Bell</a>, who died of cancer last month at age 44. I'm sure the gesture costs a six- if not a seven-figure sum, but McDonald's thinks of themselves as family and  sometimes acts more like a family-run business than a Dow Jones listed corporation.</p>
