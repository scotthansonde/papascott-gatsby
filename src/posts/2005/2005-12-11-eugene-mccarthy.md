<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/466/5775210.html" title="Minnesota senator shook world in '68">StarTribune: Minnesota senator shook world in '68</a>. Eugene McCarthy died yesterday at age 89. He took down LBJ in the New Hampshire primary in 1968, but lost the nomination to fellow Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey. McCarthy went into a sulk, left politics, and became a poet.</p>
