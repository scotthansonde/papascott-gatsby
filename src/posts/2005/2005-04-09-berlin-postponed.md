<p>We have to postpone our Berlin weekend. We both have a case of stomach flu, and decided it would be best to wait until we, and the weather, were somewhat better.</p>
<p>That means we won't be able to meet <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">Jörg and Gabi</a> as we had planned. Hopefully we can arrange a meeting next time.</p>
