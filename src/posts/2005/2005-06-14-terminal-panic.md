<p>The airport F&uuml;hlsb&uuml;ttel in Hamburg used to have Terminals 1 (charter), 2 and 3. Then they built a new Terminal 4. The ancient Terminal 2 was torn down to build a second new terminal. The entire airport was renamed <a href="http://www.hamburg-airport.de/">Hamburg Airport</a>. Terminal 3 was then closed to be rebuilt into a shopping center. Last month the new terminal on the site of Terminal 2 was named Terminal 1, the old Terminal 1 was closed, and Terminal 4 was renamed Terminal 2.</p>
<p>So, from which terminal does tomorrow's 9:55 flight to Munich take off?</p>
