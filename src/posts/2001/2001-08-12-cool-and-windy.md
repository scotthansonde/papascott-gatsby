<p>We're back! We didn't exactly have ideal beach weather (and we were cut off from the Internet) but we had a good time nonetheless. </p>

<p>Pictures from our week at Sylt are <a href="http://www.shcon.com/index.php?album=08_2001%2F20010812_sylt&dispsize=512">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>FC St. Pauli</b> <a href="http://www.bundesliga.de/en/bundesliga/2001/03/01735/nachbericht.shtml?">lost at home in the rain to Rostock 1-0</a>. They now have 2 points in 3 games for 14th place. They'll likely need 40 points in 34 games to keep from being demoted.</p>
