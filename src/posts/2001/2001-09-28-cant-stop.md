<p>Busy weekend. Christopher's day care is out-of-town today, so he's at a substitute. Mama's got a budget presentation in Munich and will be back late. I've got a company occasion this evening, so I can't pick Christopher up. His Aunt Kerstin will pick him up and he'll sleep over. Then tomorrow Mama's mother is moving. The situation has been declared as too risky for sons- and daughters-in-law, so Mama and Christopher will be driving up to help get things loaded. Christopher is responsible for keeping Oma distracted.</p>
