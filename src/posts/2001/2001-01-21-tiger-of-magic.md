<p>We just returned from Hannover, where Mama's company held a reception for their franchisees. The inauguration was on the hotel TV (4 different channels and languages) as we dressing, and at dinner I was asked about this strange and foreign ritual. One woman said that, watching without sound, the miitary parade, dark coats, somber faces and preacher looked more like a state funeral than anything else. I had no answer to that. </p>
<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/01/21">Andrea</a> asked about the movie "Fargo". Since we lived in Minnesota at the time the movie is set, I could <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1708?mode=day">answer her</a>.</p>
