<p>My brother-in-law Roland, whose motto a la Winston Churchill is "No sports," surprised me with the birthday gift of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573226882/qid=981985400/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-9101341-5003938">"Fever Pitch"</a>, the story of the author's lifelong obsession with Arsenel London. I'll have to make time to read it.</p>
<p>T-Online locked up on me today. It kept telling me 'session limit exceeded', meaning it thought I had already logged on and could not log in a second time. Logging in via modem was also blocked. Restarting isdn4linux,disconnecting the cable to the isdn card, and finally disconnecting the entire ntba did not resolve the problem. Rebooting the linux box finally did. Strange (but now I realize I should have checked if both my outgoing lines were really free).</p>
