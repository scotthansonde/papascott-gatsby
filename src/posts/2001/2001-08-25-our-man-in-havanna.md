<p>CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TRAVEL/NEWS/08/23/cuba.us.travelban/index.html">U.S. fines citizens for travel to Cuba</a>. Cuba is a standard destination for German package tours. Mama always laughingly suggested we vacation there, knowing it was illegal for me. [via <a href="http://booknotes.weblogs.com/2001/08/24">Book Notes</a>]</p>
<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Andrea</a> saw my note about being in Bremen. Turned out she was <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$699?mode=day">changing trains</a> there on her way home. Mama wanted to check out a location at the Hauptbahnhof anyway, so we got together with Andrea during her layover... exactly 12 minutes. That must be the world's shortest blogger get-together.</p>
