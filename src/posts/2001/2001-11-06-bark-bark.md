<p>I love programming for a living. You spend most of the day trying to solve riddles, only to find out that the answer was really obvious and that you were a real idiot not to see the answer right away.</p>
<p>Then again, I read a while ago that people who are truly clueless <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/psp/psp7761121.html">have no idea how clueless they are</a>. So as long I feel like an idiot, there's still hope.</p>
