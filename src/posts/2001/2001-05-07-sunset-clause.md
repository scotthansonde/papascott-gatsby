<p>As you might have guessed, the idyll on the patio last evening didn't last very long. </p>
<p>Today, we sent Grandma and Grandpa on their merry way back to Minnesota. Tomorrow, Mama returns (for a couple of days), Christopher goes back to day care, and I go back after two weeks to a refreshing day at the office.</p>
<p>Having left my parents early and moved far away, our infrequent but long visits tend to leave me with mixed feelings (there is nothing like your parents to make you feel childish). But Christopher is now something additional that we have in common.</p>
<p>Well, what you know, my employer made a profit last quarter. A whole Euro 15000. I guess that's what our CEO meant when she was hoping for a 'black zero' for the quarter.</p>
