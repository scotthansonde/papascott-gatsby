<p>Photo albums, next attempt. This time I'm going to try to do it myself: http://www.shcon.com.</p>
<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.vfth.com">Al</a> has been bitten by the hiatus bug. Hope it doesn't last too long. <i>It lasted about 2 hours!</i></p>
<p>A sign of adulthood: I'm starting to worry more about the state of the world I'm giving to my son and less about the one I inherited from my parents.</p>
<p>My mom got caught out-of-town in a tornado warning yesterday. As the radio advised anyone in a car or trailer to seek shelter immediately, she pulled up to nearest house with lights on. The family took them down to their basement, and even invited her to stay for coffee after the storm had passed.</p>
