<p>Christopher's doing better today. He was up at 6:30 reciting his entire vocabulary in alphabetical order. Constistency has improved as well, if you know what I mean. Al had a couple of <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$546?mode=day">good suggestions</a>. Substitute potatoes for toast, and you get the same advice we got here.</p>
<p>Hmmm, can I now post properly with the <a href="http://www.opera.com/linux/">Opera beta 7</a>? It wanted to supress the carriage returns before.</p>
