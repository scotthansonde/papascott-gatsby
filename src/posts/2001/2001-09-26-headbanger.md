<p>Should you ever want to compile Apache with a static PHP4 module (because, say, you're on an old Solaris system where you're not sure that dynamic modules will work), be sure to follow the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache.php">directions</a> exactly and set the --activate-module option to "libphp4.a" like it says. Even though there is a <i>libmodphp4.a</i> file, and no  libphp4.a. Setting the option to libmodphp4.a could waste hours of your time.</p>
