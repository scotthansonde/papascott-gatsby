<p><b>Late</b><br />
So, here I am performing a major update of my employer's website from the comfort of my own home. I'd normally feel more comfortable doing this after midnight rather than at 9pm, but the current sleep schedule dictates otherwise.</p>
<p>This is the 4th web agency I've worked with, and the first that leaves a competent impression. They don't have a clue about security, though, but neither did the others.</p>
<p><b>Middle</b><br />
It's snowing here, again. I thought I left Minnesota to avoid this kind of weather!</p>
<p>North of Hamburg they're having a real blizzard, with force 11 winds (they still use the Beaufort scale here... that's around 70 mph), with lots of closed roads and schools.</p>
