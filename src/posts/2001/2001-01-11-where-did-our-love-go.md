<p>This is what PapaScott thinks we look like as <a href="http://www.stor.co.uk/troopers.php">Stor Troopers</a>. (First noticed at <a href="http://singbluesilver.manilasites.com/">Sing Blue Silver</a>.)</p>
<p>Whoa, we're still trying get our bodies and souls into the rhythm of DIOKODC (double income, one kid on day care).&nbsp;Right now we're mostly tired and sometimes a little frustrated.&nbsp;So our postings have been on the lean side of between slim and none the past few days. We'll get over it.</p>
<p>At least Mama has a job title now. Department Head Operations, the more challenging of the options. A job she's done before, but then there were fewer stores, fewer&nbsp;problems,&nbsp;and no BSE.</p>
