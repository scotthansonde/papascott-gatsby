<p>Mama and Christopher hosted a get-together of her childbirth class yesterday afternoon. Notice how the kids were all bribed to sit still for the picture.</p>
<p>The same day our cat Helga left us, a <a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/2001/10/12">wet frightened kitten</a> showed up on the Donellan doorstep in Mississippi.  Today Sheila has <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/10/13">kitten pictures</a> of Papa, a grey and black tabby like Helga.</p>
<p>When we were in the States, we gave our cats German names. Our two cats now are from the States and are named <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$92">Mausi</a> and <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$90">Karl-Heinz</a>, and we've also had Marlene and Steffi. Does that mean if we were to get a cat here in Germany, it would have to get an American name?</p>
