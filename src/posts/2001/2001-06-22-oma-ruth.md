<p>Grandma Ruth is in Lüllau to visit Christopher. It's nice not to be tied to the day care schedule, for a couple of days at least.</p>
<p>I got 2 Elsa AirLancer wireless (802.11b) cards on Monday, so that my Think Pad would be truly wireless. Today, 4 days later, I finally figured out the correct parameters so the card is recognized by my Linux router. I've rarely been so happy about a successful ping!</p>
