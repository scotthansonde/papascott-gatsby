<p>Woke up at 6, just in time to see the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/scores/20011031/arinyy.html">final box score of Game 4</a> on Yahoo. Rats. <i>But Christopher again is still asleep!</i></p>
<p>Got our first look at the new <a href="http://www.euro.ecb.int/en/section.html">euro currency</a> last night, 6 weeks ahead of the general public. Mama had a euro training class at work, and received an envelope with 3 bills and 8 coins totalling 38.88. The coins are heavy!</p>
<p>A <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/ViewPhoto?u=719470&a=13934878&p=55850356">Mac-o-Lantern</a> found buried on Slashdot. Scary.</p>
<p>John Robb asked <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2001/10/31.html">yesterday</a> whether the US Postal Service is worth saving. Who owns the USPS these days anyway? I spent 10 minutes clicking around their <a href="http://www.usps.com">website</a>, and left without a clue. For the German post, I had the <a href="http://investorrelations.dpwn.de/index_en.html">answer</a> within 3 clicks (that they are a publically traded corporation in which the German government holds a majority share).</p>
