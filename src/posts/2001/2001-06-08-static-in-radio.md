<p>Maybe the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/min/">Twins</a> aren't for real after all. It looks like they are about to lose 3 out of 4 to Cleveland at home. Ouch. As for the Mariners, I hope they have a World Series on whatever planet they are playing on.</p>
<p>I'm putting together a website for the local daycare organization, just 5 or 6 static pages. I heard somewhere (<a href="http://www.derschockwellenreiter.de/">Der Schockwellenreiter</a> maybe?) that "Radio Userland" can do static websites just like "Frontier", so I thought I would give it a try. It has been over 2 years since I had put together a website (or in fact had done anything) in Frontier. I had forgotten how much fun it is. I had to look up a few things in the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tutorial/">tutorial</a>, and I still have a couple of questions (like how do I get an graphic from my #images table in the background of a table cell in my #template), but within a couple of hours I had the site pretty much working as I wanted it to.</p>
<p>I put the layout up at http://shanson.bei.t-online.de. I don't want to show what a hot designer I am (I'm not), but I do think it turned out well. Bright, colorful and childish.</p>
<p>My complaint about Radio would be that it's such a Swiss Army Knife with so many different blades, the menus are confusing when I only want to use one of its functions. It is especially confusing since the menus do not match the Frontier menus mentioned in the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tutorial/">tutorial</a> pointed to on the Radio <a href="http://radio.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3378">static sites tool page</a>. I don't think someone with no contact with Frontier would be able to put up a static site. That's too bad, because that's a functionality that I think would be the most interesting to newbies, before they become interested in newsfeeds and weblogs and all the other blades on the knife.</p>
