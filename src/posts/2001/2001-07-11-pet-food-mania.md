<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/07/11">Scripting News</a> today mentions Pet-Food-Mania as the height of dot-com insanity. The <a href="http://inessential.com/2001/07/09.html">demise</a> of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/images/webvanceasesoperations.gif">Webvan</a> shows that you can't even sell people food on the Internet these days. In Germany we haven't had a dot-com crash yet, and we could still buy groceries at <a href="http://www.einkauf24.de">Einkauf24.de</a> or at <a href="http://www.shopping24.de">Shopping24.de</a>. But we don't. I'm not sure if they even deliver to Lüllau.</p>
<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Andrea</a> asks today: <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/07/11">What do you want to do when you grow up?</a> I don't know, I'm not grown up yet. ";->"</p>
