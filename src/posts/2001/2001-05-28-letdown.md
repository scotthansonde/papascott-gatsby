<p>We made it back from Amsterdam, and we're still tired. Christopher slept 3 hours more than usual today, and he's not caught up with his sleep either. We're all kind of depressed today, the weather is rainy, and work is, well, work.</p>
<p>I'll write up my notes under the story <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$600">Amsterdam</a> until they are ready to post, so you can read them in progress (that way I have no pressure to get them done). </p>
<p><b>Van Gogh</b></p>

<p>Here's Mama and Christopher in line at the <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/">Van Gogh Museum</a> on Sunday. Christopher can hardly wait for the dose of culture that he's about to be fed. His favorite painting was <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/collection/catalog/vglpainting.asp?ARTID=1&LANGID=0&SEL=1&PERIOD=1&SORT=NaN">The Potato Eaters</a>, for obvious reasons (he likes anything to do with eating). Mama and I both liked <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/collection/catalog/vglpainting.asp?ARTID=86&LANGID=0&SEL=1&PERIOD=3&SORT=NaN">The Langlois Bridge</a>, but it wasn't for sale. Not even as a print. </p>
