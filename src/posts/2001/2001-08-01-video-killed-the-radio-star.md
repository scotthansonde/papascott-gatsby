<p>Most days, spending time alone with my son is a rewarding experience. Today was not one of them. Mama is out of town until Friday night, so I'm working both early and late (parental) shifts. This evening, Christopher cried for 90 minutes straight. Not the stubborn 'I want my way' cry, or the familiar 'feed me now' cry. Even in the bath he cried. I don't what he was trying to say. Maybe he was just tired. I ended up putting him to bed early, skipping supper. I have no idea whether that was right or wrong. Right now, <i>I'm</i> tired.</p>
