<p>We put a battery in Christopher's toy drill yesterday. Now it makes the noise it's supposed to make, although he can still put his own drill together with Legos and make his own sound effects.</p>
<p>Christopher is starting to build cool things with Legos. Six months ago he was happy (and his parents proud) to be able to stack 6 or 8 pieces into a straight block, no corners sticking out. He's now stacking up (and knocking down) tall towers.</p>
<p>Adam talks about <a href="http://mtv.curry.com/stories/storyReader$15">partying with Prince at Paisley Park</a>. We were in Minneapolis at that time; the club he mentions is <a href="http://www.first-avenue.com">1st Avenue</a> (not 7th Avenue, as I originally wrote), where much of Purple Rain was filmed and of which Prince was rumored to be part owner. I never saw him there, though, but I did see the Ramones 3 times there.</p>
