<p>Today I think I'm thinking straight for the first time since Tuesday. Our satellite receiver has been replaced, so we're receiving clear pictures again. My cousin Tracy was my only family member affected by events... she was stranded in Alabama and couldn't fly home, so she rented a car for a 24-hour drive back to Minnesota. My brother called out of the blue yesterday evening, 'just to talk'. </p>
