<p>Mama checked in from Verona this evening (via hotel phone, so we kept it short). She was at a do-it-yourself pasta restaurant this afternoon. Do-it-yourself as in here's an egg, 100 g flour, and a rolling pin. Roll it yourself. I had to think of <a href="http://www.vfth.com">Al</a> as she was telling me this. So maybe now she'll know what to do with that pasta machine we've had sitting around for years.</p>
