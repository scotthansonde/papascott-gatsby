<p>Astute readers will have noticed by now that I often give titles to my pages that have nothing to do with the content. <a href="http://www.vfth.com">Al</a> names his pages after song titles, but he at least gives the lyrics. I don't even bother to do that. My title yesterday was a current German pop song sung by TV actresses. Noone outside of Germany would recognize it, and since German webloggers don't watch TV and only listen to <a href="http://www.sexyjazz.de">sexyjazz</a>, no German reader would have recognized it either.</p>
