<p>Mama should be in Italy by now, for her opera field trip with the executive board. She found an earlier flight for the return trip on Saturday, so we won't need a helicopter after all.</p>
<p>Responding to the <a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=1115/byt20010824s0001/">Byte article</a> about the lack of dual boot machines, and the question that who really wants one anyway, <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2001/08/28">Al</a> responded that he likes dual booting MacOS 9 and OS X, and is looking forward to dual booting OS X.1 and Linux on his next machine. I'm just curious, Al, what do want in Linux that you don't have in OS X and <a href="http://www.publicsource.apple.com/projects/darwin/">Darwin</a>, its BSD heart and soul? Especially since the <a href="http://elisa.utopianet.net/~rlucia/devel/darwin_ports/">FreeBSD Ports</a> are being, er, ported to Darwin, it's going to have all the cool, fun stuff Linux has, plus the cool OS X desktop, without having to deal with an ugly Linux install.</p>
