<p><a href="http://fourstones.net/AutoWiner.php?vip2=Christopher%20Ryan&mood=Merry_Mentor">AutoWiner</a>: "I thought I made a good point and Christopher Ryan agreed."</p>
<p><a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2001/07/16">John</a> points to the <a href="http://www.iowastatefair.org/">Iowa State Fair spokespig</a>. The <a href="http://www.mnstatefair.org/">Minnesota State Fair</a> puts on a more sophisticated air and does not have a spokespig, although I assume that the two fairs are pretty much the same. Minnesotans are snobs, especially when comparing Minnesota to Iowa.</p>
<p>Actually, Minnesotans rarely stoop to comparing Minnesota to Iowa, or even to Chicago. Culturally, Minnesotans feel that only New York and Europe are worthy of comparison. When <a href="http://www.prairiehome.org/cast/garrison_keillor.shtml">Garrison Keillor</a> wanted to exile himself from Minnesota, he didn't move to Des Moines. He first moved to Denmark, but it wasn't far enough away, so he moved on to New York. But he eventually came back.</p>
