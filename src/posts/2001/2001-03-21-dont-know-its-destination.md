<p><b>Proud to be German?</b><br />
<a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=&#123;B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88&#125;&doc=&#123;D9E673E0-1D33-11D5-A3B5-009027BA22E4&#125;">Background</a> from the conservative FAZ (English Edition).  State elections (coming up this weekend) seem to bring out the worst in German politicians, whether it's a petition against dual-citizenship, a 'Kinder staat Inder' (children not Indians) campaign against the green card, or now a silly debate whether it's OK to say that one is proud to be German. It seems especially silly to me, being born in a country where patriotism is, well, as American as apple pie. It's fun listening to CDU politicians whine, though. Helmut Kohl never had such a thin skin. Kohl was never thin, period.</p>
<p>Ich muß Harald Schmidt zustimmen: lieber stolz, ein Deutscher zu sein, als stolz, Laurenz Meyer zu sein!</p>
