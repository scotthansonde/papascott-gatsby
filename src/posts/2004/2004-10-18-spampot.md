<p>Last Tuesday I quietly installed <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> and opened comments on all of my previous blog entries. The first spam arrived the next day. The statistics for the past 5 days are:<br />
* Comment spams blocked:  	 285<br />
* Comment spams moderated: 	3 (of which 2 were truly spam)<br />
* Comment spams posted: 0</p>
