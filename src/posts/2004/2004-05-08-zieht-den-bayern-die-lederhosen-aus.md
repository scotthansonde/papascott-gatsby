<p>(Pull the pants off the Bavarians!) Bayern Munich is the New York Yankees of German soccer: rich, arrogant, hated and successful. It is therefore gives me great satisfaction to report that <a title="Werder demütigt den FC Bayern ... [jimmiz journal]" href="http://jimmiz.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=374">Bayern was defeated by Bremen at home 3-1</a>, thus clinching the Bundesliga title for Bremen. I may not live to see Bayern relegated, but it's nice to see them lose once in a while, especially to a northern team.</p>
