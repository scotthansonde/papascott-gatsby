<p>Most of what <a title="Scripting News: 1/27/2004" href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/01/27#When:6:55:57AM">Dave says</a> (well, said... he's since edited his post) about the Dean blog can be applied to <a title="MirowFuerHamburg.de" href="http://www.mirowfuerhamburg.de/">MirowFuerHamburg</a> as well: "Lots of epitaphs about Dean blogging and how it helped or hurt the campaign. They're all making the same basic mistake. They never did blogging at the Dean campaign. They have a house organ, it was a fictional thing, always glad about the good news, even when the news was bad. Weblogs are grounded in reality, they report on anything that an intelligent and curious person would want to know. The Dean blog assumes that you are a convert to the cause. The Dean weblog is not a trial of blogs in a presidential campaign, when that day comes, there won't be a disconnect between the candidate... and what's on the Web."</p>
