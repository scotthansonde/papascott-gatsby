<p>The tech project from hell: the German transport ministry today announced the <a title="Expatica" href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=52&story_id=4751">cancellation of its contract with Toll Collect</a> to build a satellite-based toll and tracking system for trucks. The system had been scheduled to go into operation in August 2003, less than a year after the project was awarded to the consortium led by Daimler Chrysler and Deutsche Telekom. After several catastrophic failures during live testing, Toll Collect is now unable to commit to any start date. The agreement finally fell apart over liability for lost revenue of over 180 million Euros per month.</p>
