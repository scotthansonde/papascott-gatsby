<p>A couple of years ago, I posted about the possibility that <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/08/04/in-laws-to-royalty/">a distant cousin was married to a member of the Norwegian royal family</a>. My great-uncle who told the story has since passed away, and among his effects was a newspaper article about <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/bios/aarvik.html">Egil Aarvig</a> (1912-1990), Norwegian politician, newspaper editor and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. My grandmother's maiden name was Aakvik, so it could very well be that we are related to the late Norwegian politician. Whether he had married into the royal family is yet unclear.</p>
