<p>At work we're a waiting on the result of a court order <em><a href="http://dict.leo.org/?search=injunction">(einstweilige Verfügung)</a></em>. I thought there was a song about waiting on an injunction, but I guess I was thinking of Losing My Religion by R.E.M. So we'll have to go with <a href="http://www.geocities.com/regitorico/shouldi.htm">The Clash</a>: </p>
<p>"Should I stay or should I go now?<br />
Should I stay or should I go now?<br />
If I go there will be trouble<br />
An' if I stay it will be double<br />
So you gotta let me know<br />
Should I stay or should I go?"</p>
