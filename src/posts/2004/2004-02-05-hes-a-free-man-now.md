<p>As expected, a court in Hamburg today <a title="Sept. 11 Terror Suspect Acquitted| Current Affairs | Deutsche Welle | 05.02.2004" href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_1105350_1_A,00.html">acquitted 9/11 suspect Abdelghani Mzoudi</a> due to lack of evidence. The prosecution will appeal the verdict, and the Hamburg Justice Ministry has announced they will begin deportation proceedings. The case against Mzoudi was thin to begin with. The investigation against him was still incomplete as he was arrested attempting to leave Germany. The United States did not share witnesses and evidence that could have led to a conviction, citing the need to keep certain information from becoming public. It's a difficult choice, deciding between a conviction of a terrroist collaborator and keeping information secret that could help future terrorists. It's better to let a guilty man go free than to endanger future victims, but it is a bitter decision for the families of past victims.</p>
