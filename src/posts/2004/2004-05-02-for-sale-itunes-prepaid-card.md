<p>While in the U.S. of A., I picked up a $15 <a title="Apple - Support - iTunes Music Store Customer Service" href="http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/giving_gcs.html">iTunes Prepaid Card</a> from Target, thinking I could thus sample the lovely graces of the iTunes Music Store. However, I didn't read the fine print, which requires that I set up a Music Store account to redeem the card. Since I don't have a US credit card, and I'm too old to ask my mother to use hers, I was unable to use the card. Anyone want to buy it, payment via PayPal? Send me a mail, make me an offer I can't refuse (over $14).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The card is sold! No more inquiries, please.</p>
