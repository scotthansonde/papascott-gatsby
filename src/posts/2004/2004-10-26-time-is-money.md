<p>The next couple of weeks I might have very little time to write here, as the wife is in Budapest this week and then next week off to Sydney for 10 days, leaving the men alone at home.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I might soon have all the time in the world to write for PapaScott. Very soon. Details as they come in.</p>
