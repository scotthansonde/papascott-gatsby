<p>I'm glad I'm not a Spanish voter. With the tragedy in Madrid just days before todays election, the facts are still unclear, and and least from here it seems both main parties were trying to twist the facts to their advantage. The voters thought the ruling conservatives went too far, and despite leading the polls they <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | Spanish government admits defeat" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3511280.stm">appear to have lost</a>, with a large voter turnout. And Aznar bows out not so gracefully, handing power to the leftist oppostition rather than his designated successor. The message of the voters is not one of weakness in the face of terror, but rather an insistance that any government deal honestly with its citizens in time of crisis. Voters by definition are always right. Do not lie to them, they do not take deception lightly.</p>
