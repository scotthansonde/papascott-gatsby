<p>Today is the 60th anniversary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_20_Plot">attempt to assassinate Hitler</a> on 20 July 1944. The date is well marked in Germany. The Bendlerblock, the Wehrmacht headquarters in Berlin where the conspirators were executed that same evening, has become a shrine of sorts for the present-day Bundeswehr, and the date has been marked in recent years by a ceremony for new recruits in the Bendlerblock courtyard.</p>
<p>I imagine the date passes elsewhere almost unnoticed. Indeed, the failed coup is no more than a tragic asterisk in the history of the war. Modern Germany would desperately like to find a pinpoint of light, to grasp a shred of redemption from that absolute darkness. The German reverence of 20 July is an attempt at self-therapy, to forget all the horrors, when in fact the world will not forget the horrors carried out by Germans.</p>
<p>The plotters of 20 July were not saints or heroes, but human beings who recovered their humanity all too late. May they rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.billspricht.net/2004_07_18_archive.html#109035536770175063">Bill</a>, <a href="http://expat-odyssey.blogspot.com/2004/07/who-were-true-german-heros.html">Duncan</a>, <a href="http://lillimarleen.blogspot.com/2004/07/july-20th-in-germany-yes-in-germany.html">Lilli Marleen</a> and <a href="http://couchblog.de/webpropaganda/article/321/">Webpropaganda</a> on this as well. Most of them mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose">Hans & Shophie Scholl</a> as truer heroes than the plotters of 20 July. While I <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/11/07/the-greatest-germans/">admire</a> the Scholls, I don't think the comparison is apt. The White Rose was a bold and heroic <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/20/no-redemption/#comment-1426">gesture</a>, doomed to failure from the start. The Wehrmacht officers, on the other hand, were willing allies of Hitler for years before July 1944.</p>
