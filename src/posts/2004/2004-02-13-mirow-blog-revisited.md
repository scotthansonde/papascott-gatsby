<p>Here's a follow up on my <a title="PapaScott: Mirow Blog" href="http://www.papascott.de/2004/01/24/2819.php">post last month</a> on the weblog of SPD leading candidate in Hamburg, <a title="MirowFuerHamburg.de: Treffpunkt für Unterstützer" href="http://www.mirowfuerhamburg.de/">Thomas Mirow</a>. They've fixed some of the things I complained about in my first post. There's now a big link to the blog from the <a title="Thomas Mirow - Bürgermeister für Hamburg" href="http://www.thomasmirow.de/mirow/start.html">campaign's main web site</a>. The posters at the blog now call themselves "Team Mirow" instead of pretending to be Thomas Mirow... so they're still anonymous, but at least they are being honest about it. And the weblog now bills itself as a 'meeting place for supporters', which means the weblog has a clear and achievable focus. So did the makers of the weblog read my post and take my comments seriously? Well, maybe <a title="Noch'n Blogg" href="http://blogg.lumma.de/">one</a> of them did. Is that the reason that Red/Green has <a title="Wahl in Hamburg: Umfrage: Aufwärtstrend bei rot-grün" href="http://interferno.org/wahlinhamburg/archiv/000102.html">pulled even</a> with the CDU in the latest polls? I doubt it.</p>
