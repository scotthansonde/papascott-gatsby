<p>We don't yet have any Apple Stores in Germany, but we do now have an <a title="heise online - Saturn eröffnet seinen ersten Apple Shop-in-Shop" href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/54478">Apple Shop-in-Shop</a> at the Saturn Megastore in downtown Hamburg, in case you're looking to pick up some white plastic stuff for the holidays. (Actually, Saturn has always sold Macs in the back corner of the basement... it looks like they just found a new corner and with new wallpaper and Apple logos.)</p>
