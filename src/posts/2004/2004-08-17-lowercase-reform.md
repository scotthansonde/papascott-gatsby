<p><a href="http://kalsey.com/2004/08/lowercase_style/" title="Lowercase style :: Kalsey Consulting Group">Adam Kalsey</a> points to a change in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64596,00.html" title="It's Just the 'internet' Now">Wired Style</a> that internet and web are now written in lower case. Note that this <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/07/good-speling/">spelling reform</a> has nothing to do with politics, but what (now) makes the most sense. The <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/StyleGuide/">Economist Style Guide</a> is also a good source of good sense</p>
