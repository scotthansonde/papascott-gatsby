<p>In citing a rant about <a title="Eamonn Fitzgerald's Rainy Day: German anti-Americanism redux" href="http://www.eamonn.com/archives/001354.html#001354">the anti-American German press</a> (ironically, from a German journalist in the German press), Eamonn makes the assertion (common among warbloggers) that "only by cynical Bush-baiting (did Schröder) manage to cling to power".</p>
<p>I'm just wondering, is there any political data to either back this up or refute this?  My gut feeling is that this is not directly true, as Stoiber did not present a clear alternative on Iraq (in fact, in the end, <a href="http://www.papascott.de/2002/09/19/1887.php">he was even more anti-war than Schröder</a>). But are there any polls or analyses on the effect of the Iraq issue on the 2002 election?</p>
