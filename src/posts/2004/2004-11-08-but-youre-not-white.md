<p><a href="http://www.neilarmstrong.de/weblog/2004_11_01_archive.html#109976265621517065" title="German For Beginners: Where is that, exactly?">German For Beginners:</a> "Whenever a person asks V where she's from and she says that she's English and was born in London, I'm amazed at the number who look at her and ask "Ja, aber woher kommen Sie wirklich?" - "where are you from, really?" I think it's the outright, unabashed, "but, but you're not white", inherent in the statement." Funny, that never happens to me. But then again, Germans were never known for subtlety.</p>
