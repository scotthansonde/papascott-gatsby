<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/09/windows_vs_world" title="Daring Fireball: Windows Versus the World">Daring Fireball:</a> "there's very little doubt in my mind now that 'desktop Linux' market share is going to surge past the Macintosh into second place.... (Not that) this (is) bad news for Apple... I think the market for desktop Linux - both in homes and corporations - is very different than the market Apple is targeting. Rising desktop Linux market share comes at the expense of Windows' market share, not the Mac's."</p>
