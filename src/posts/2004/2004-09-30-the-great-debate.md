<p>No, I won't be staying up to watch <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002538.shtml" title="The great debate by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">The Great Debate</a> at 3 am German time. I'm totally unenthused by Kerry (of the 4 main Democratic candidates, I think he was about 4th best), but I already know what I think of Bush. My mind is made up, so the debate won't influence me one way or the other... unless, of course, Kerry turns out to be the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056218/" title="IMDB: Manchurian Candidate, The (1962)">Manchurian Candidate</a> with Angela Lansbury manipulating his brain. (With that hair, you can't really tell.) But I'm sure the blogosphere will let me know if that's the case without my having to watch the debate live.</p>
