<p><a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/05/27/1635252">Linux.com: Perl's Tie::File module</a>: "The second (reason I became a systems administrator) is that I'm not particularly fond of writing code. If I were, I'd probably be a programmer. As it stands, if I can find tools that work, I won't write code. (If) I have no choice... I at least want to write very little code." True. And BTW, Tie::File is a handy Perl module</p>
