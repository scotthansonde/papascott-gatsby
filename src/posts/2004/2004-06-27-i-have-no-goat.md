<p><em>Null Bock</em> is the German phrase that describes my mood today. It literally means "no goat", but in this case means I'm feeling bored and apathetic.</p>
<p>While on the subject of silly German phrases, it betrays my age pretty exactly to admit the first hip German word I learned was <em>Affentittengeil</em> (literally "monkey tits horny"), something  I haven't heard since the early '80s. (Does that qualify me to march in the <a href="http://www.schlagermove.de/index.php?page=home&city=hamburg">Schlager Move</a> in Hamburg next weekend?)</p>
