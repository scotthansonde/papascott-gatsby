<p>According to Spiegel Online, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,314322,00.html" title="München: US-Tourist wegen Maßkrug-Diebstahl vier Wochen in Haft - Panorama - SPIEGEL ONLINE">a US tourist spent 4 weeks in custody</a> awaiting trial for stealing a beer mug (value 8) from the Hofbräuhaus in Munich. Since the student from New Mexico resisted pursuit, he was charged with robbery (usual sentence: 1 year). The judge disagreed, and sent the student home with a fine of 1260.</p>
