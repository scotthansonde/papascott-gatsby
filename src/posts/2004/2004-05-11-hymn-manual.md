<p><a title="Hymn Manual" href="http://hymn-project.org/docs/hymn-manual.html#faq-technical">Hymn Manual:</a> "Apple creates excellent products. OS X is the most usable commercial operating system I've ever experienced. The iPod is great little device. The iTunes Music Store is a great way to buy music. Technologically speaking, I am enamored with almost everything they do. Ethically / legally speaking, however, they are (unfortunately) just as bad as most other big corporations."</p>
