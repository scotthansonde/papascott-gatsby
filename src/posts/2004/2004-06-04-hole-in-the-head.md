<p>We're going on an involuntary hiatus. Something has gone wrong with our change in telekom provider, and we have no telephone, no ISDN, and no Internet at home. I'm sure that Deutsche Telekom is working feverishly to fix the problem. Meanwhile we can only be reached by cell phone or at work. Maybe this weekend we'll watch a movie. Or read a book. </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> I should have never doubted the Deutsche Telekom. Within in hour the ISDN line was up. In a few days we might even have DSL.</p>
