<p>Matthew asks <a href="http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001900.html" title="The Silent Penguin: DNC - more than just Kerry?">What's the big deal about the Democratic convention?</a> "I mean Kerry is set to be nominated, so that would take like half an hour. Then they could release the balloons, have a speech and be back on the road by midday.What else?"</p>
<p>Well, technically the convention is like a German <em>Parteitag</em>, with delegates voting on personel, resolutions and positions for the campaign. But in reality it's a scripted media circus... but it's an important circus nonetheless. Being able to put on a good circus is an essential quality for a president. For 4 days the Democrats have the party have the media stage to themselves and on their terms. Americans have had 4 years to form an impression of the incumbant, but only a few months to get to know the challenger. If he can't make a good impression now, he never will.</p>
<p>In an American presidential election it is very difficult to defeat an incumbant. Clinton did it, Carter was a special case, otherwise you have to go back to FDR in 1932. If Kerry is to have a chance this November, he needs to put on a good convention.</p>
<p>(Back in the States when I was young, I was a delegate at a couple of political conventions, but only up to the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/19/i-have-a-voice/">congressional district level</a>, never state or national.)</p>
