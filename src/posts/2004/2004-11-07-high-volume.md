<p>I recently purchased an iPod, but was disappointed with the sound. It was simply not loud enough. I took the the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Applied <a title="iPod Volume Booster (English)" href="http://volumebooster.tangerine-soft.de/">iPod Volume Booster</a> to remove the EU volume restriction.<br />
2. Purchased a set of <a href="http://www.minidisc.com.au/product_info.php?products_id=421">plug-style earphones</a>.<br />
3. Imported appropriate music (Ramones, Donnas, Ärzte, etc.).</p>
<p>Ah. Much better.</p>
