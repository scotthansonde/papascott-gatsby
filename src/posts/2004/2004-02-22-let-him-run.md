<p><a title="MSNBC - Ralph Nader to run for president" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4312689/">MSNBC: Ralph Nader to run for president</a>, this time as an independent. And the Democrats have already begun to gnash their teeth. Didn't Nader cost them the last election? Since I voted for Nader in 2000, I can answer that with no. To think otherwise is to believe that voters are dumb. They are not. My vote was actually not <em>for</em> Nader, but <em>against</em> Gore, whom in 2000 I saw <a title="PapaScott: Vision Thing" href="http://www.papascott.de/2000/11/04/1361.php">no reason</a> to support, nothing to distinguish him from the other candidate. If Nader weren't on the ballot, I would have voted for another 3rd candidate, or for nobody at all. Things are different now. Bush is a known quantity, we know what we have if he is re-elected. Distinguishing the two major candidates is not going to be a problem this year. So let Nader run. I won't be voting for him, and he won't make any difference.</p>
