<p>I first was aware of politics when I was 5 years old. I knew a few basic facts. The president was Lyndon Johnson, there was a war in Vietnam, and the governor was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/05/politics/05WIRE-REAGAN.html?ex=1401854400&en=6e15cdfead6e276b&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND" title="The New York Times > Washington > Reagan Had Long Struggle With Alzheimer's Disease">Ronald Reagan</a>. My dad worked for the state of California, so Ronald Reagan was his boss.</p>
<p>One thing not mentioned in the NYT obituary: Reagan's election as governor in 1966 sparked the first campus protests at UC Berkeley, and thus the entire student protest movement of the 1960s.</p>
<p>As a college freshman in 1980, my first and only experience as a real journalist was covering the state  Republican election party for student radio. Carter conceeded before we reached the hotel.</p>
<p>I think I saw him once, as a blurry shadow in a speeding limo. He was in Minneapolis for a fundraiser. I was in demonstration protesting against something or other.</p>
<p>He was a kind and gentle man whose policies made America less kind and less gentle. I do think he helped to end the Cold War, but not through harsh threats and weapons programs, but through his human friendship with a man named Gorbachev.</p>
