<p>It worked! :-) At least 95% worked, and the few problems could be easily fixed. Two notes:</p>
<p>1. We decided to skip domain mapping, since we don't have a group for all Samba users, and Samba 3 only maps one-to-one. </p>
<p>2. To convert the SIDs, I exported the smbpasswd to XML, added line breaks, ran this perl script, and imported into samtdb.</p>
<p>:<br />
    #!/usr/bin/perl<br />
    while (<>) {<br />
        if (/sid=/) {<br />
                /-(d+)"/;<br />
                my $oldrid=$1;<br />
                my $newrid= (($oldrid-1000)*2)+1000 ;<br />
                s/-d+"/-$newrid"/;<br />
        }<br />
        print;<br />
    }</p>
