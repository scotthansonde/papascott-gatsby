<p>(Yes, <a title="Lilli Marleen" href="http://lillimarleen.blogspot.com/">Lilli</a>, I'm talking to you!) If you want to make it easier for people to read your blog, please turn on your site feed! In your Blogger interface, go to Settings -> Site Feed, set Publish Site Feed to Yes and Descriptions to Full. Then those of us with RSS/Atom aggregators will be able to see your new posts right away. I even started a <a title="PapaSpot" href="http://papaspot.blogspot.com/">test blogspot blog</a> to <a href="http://papaspot.blogspot.com/atom.xml">see how it works</a>. Thank you!</p>
