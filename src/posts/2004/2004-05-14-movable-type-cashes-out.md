<p>The weblog world is <a title="Burningbird - Spin City" href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/05/14/spin-city/">ablaze</a> with the news of the <a title="Mena's Corner: It's About Time" href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml">new licensing scheme</a> for <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>. $99 for a personal version, a free version limited to 1 author and 3 weblogs, with the top commercial version (20 authors) at $599. A bit overpriced, I would say. If I were to introduce weblogs into my company's intranet (100 employees), it would be cheaper to install a Notes server (<em>with</em> hardware and much more functionality) than to license MT.</p>
<p>The controversy, though, reminds me of when Userland Frontier went commercial in the late '90s. A great product, an active developer community... but when it was no longer free, the community disintegrated. I hope that Six Apart is paying attention, and will rethink its pricing.</p>
