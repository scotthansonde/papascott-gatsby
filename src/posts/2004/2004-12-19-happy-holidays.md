<p>My parents arrived safely on Friday, the <a href="http://www.linde-gastherapeutics.com/International/Web/LG/templ/Likelgalhtempl.nsf/DocByAlias/hc_trav">oxygen concentrator</a> for my father is up and running, Mama and I are both off work, Christopher has his grandparents wrapped around his little finger, we're getting the Christmas tree today, the Christmas baking and cooking are planned for this week, and of course the big birthday on the 27th, so don't expect much writing here for the next two weeks. Maybe some pictures. We'll see.</p>
