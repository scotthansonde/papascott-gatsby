<p>My American readers might not be familiar with the <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2004/05.html#25povertyhttp://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2004/05.html#25poverty">concept</a>, so let me explain how it works. When I hurt my leg the other day, I was able to leave work early. It doesn't count against any time off or anything, and nothing gets docked off my pay. And when I went to the specialist to have it checked, it doesn't really matter to me whether workers comp covers it or not, because either way I don't pay. And when the doctor recommends that I rest the leg for a couple of days, that means I get the time off work, paid. And even if the company goes bankrupt and I lose my job, I do not lose my health coverage. I don't have to pay an arm and a leg for health care. That's how it works.</p>
