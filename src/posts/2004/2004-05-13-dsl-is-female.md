<p>After weeks of pre-publicity, now we know. Alice is a <a title="Alice-DSL" href="http://www.alice-dsl.de/">DSL product</a> from local provider HanseNet (a subsidiary of Telecom Italia), and is embodied (so to speak) not by an avatar but by a <a title="Hamburgs teuerste Kampagne: 1,5 Millionen Euro für Alice" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2004/05/11/293517.html">real-live 17-year-old model</a> in heels and a high slit dress. 'Alice is fast.' 'Alice is dependable.' At least we are being spared 'Alice is cheap' or 'Alice is easy'. The posters are tame compared to, say, those from H&M, but the idea is still questionable. If there were a German version of <a title="misbehaving.net is a weblog about women and technology" href="http://www.misbehaving.net/">misbehaving.net</a>, they'd be having a field day.</p>
