<p>As I arrived at Hauptbahnhof this afternoon, ready to take the S-Bahn to my park-and-ride lot, suddenly all southbahn S-Bahn traffic was halted. "Fire on the tracks at Wilhelmsburg. No S-Bahn until further notice. Passengers should take DB trains to Harburg." Except my car was between Harburg and Hauptbahnhof, so getting to Harburg would not have helped. After 30 minutes, I was ready to grab a cab... then the S-Bahn started rolling again. I made it home just 5 minutes before Christopher's bus. But I see I need to work out a Plan B for reaching the park-and-ride lot, since the S-Bahn is known to be occasionally buggy.</p>
