<p>We  tried to tell my mother-in-law that she did not have to come feed our cat Nena while we were gone this weekend. I mean, we were only gone two days, and cats can survive for weeks without human attention. But she has a key to the house (my mother-in-law, not Nena), so we couldn't stop her. And she was shocked as Nena brought a mouse to the patio, and proceeded to eat the mouse, completely, on the spot, from head to tail.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law loves cats, as she remembers the kitten she had as a young girl, but has never had a cat since her childhood, and thus doesn't really understand cats at all.</p>
<p>I thought Nena was being quite considerate to her guest host. Usually she leaves the head for us to pick up in the morning.</p>
