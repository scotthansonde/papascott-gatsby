<p>As the first consequence of our visit with the <a title="PapaScott : Speech Therapy" href="http://www.papascott.de/2003/12/23/2769.php">speech therapist</a> last month, we took Christopher to a ear-nose-throat specialist today. He told us what we already suspected: Christopher has fluid behind the eardrums in both ears, his adenoids are enlarged, and he is a classic candidate for an adenoidectomy. I was surprised that he recommended surgery right away (I had a similar operation at age 8), but doing some reading I learned that such a procedure at age 4 is not unusual, and these days can be done as an out-patient. We've made an appointment for the end of the month. We also had a hearing test done, but since Christopher was somewhat uncooperative, the results were inconclusive. He only hears what he wants to hear. Don't we all?</p>
