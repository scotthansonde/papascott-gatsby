<p>I won't be able to make it to <a href="http://blogtalk.net/" title="BlogTalk 2.0 - nice to meet you there">BlogTalk</a> in Vienna next month. I have to do the child care thing at home, as my wife has to be in Lisbon on the 4th. Her company is sponsoring a football tournament there or something.</p>
