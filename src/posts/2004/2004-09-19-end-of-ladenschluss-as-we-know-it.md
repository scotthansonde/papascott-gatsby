<p>Round the clock shopping in Germany? Bild am Sonntag is reporting that a bill to be introduced in the Bundesrat would <a href="http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/2004/09/19/ladenschluss__aus/ladenschluss__aus.html" title="Bild.T-Online.de - Nachrichten - 10 Bundesländer machen mit: Ladenschluss- Revolution!">transfer control of shop hours from the federal government to the states </a>. Such a bill almost certainly pass the Bundestag as well, since both major parties support it. Ten of the 16 German <em>Länder</em> would probably then do away with  restrictions on shop hours altogether Mon-Sat, while keeping the ban on Sundays. </p>
<p>I'll believe it first when I see it, but labor unions certainly have less influence on state goverments than on the national Red/Green coalition, so it could actually happen.</p>
