<p>A reader mailed me this link from the <a title="Telegraph | Property | An ill wind blowing?" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2004/02/14/pfarm14.xml&sSheet=/property/2004/02/14/ixptop01.html">Daily Telegraph</a> on a couple in England living 500 m from 4 wind generators (similar to what we might face here): "One of the myths put out by the (wind energy) industry is that a wind farm sounds like a stream from 50 yards. We've got a stream running through our garden and if you stand by it, you can hear the whooshing of the turbines above the water. I've lived the same distance from the M3 and that didn't bother me anything like as much as the wind farm."</p>
