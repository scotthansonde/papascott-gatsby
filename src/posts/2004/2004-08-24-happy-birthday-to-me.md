<p><a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002433.shtml">Heiko notes</a> that <a href="http://www.evhead.com/2004/08/five-years-ago-today-we-just-launched.asp">PyraLabs launched Blogger five years ago</a>. Which means that <a href="http://www.papascott.de/blogger99.html">I've been weblogging for five years</a>. I just didn't know what I was doing back then. (I'm guessing I saw it <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/1999/08/23">here</a>.)</p>
