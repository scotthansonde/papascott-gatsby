<p>blogg.de is a German combination of Blogspot and Technorati... it's a floor wax <em>and</em> a desert topping!* Er, I mean it's a hoster <em>and</em> an aggregator. And like Technorati, it's been having it's problems lately. Nico mentions his current  <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=467" title="mysqlsnapshot [Lummaland]">love/hate relationship with MySQL</a> and the Zawondny tool <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mysqlsnapshot/">mysqlsnapshot</a>. I hope he's reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596003064" title="High Performance MySQL">Zawodny book</a> as well. I found it helpful when rearranging IPs for my absolutely-has-to-be-up bugtracker database. Generally, I've found that problems I seem to be having with MySQL can either be tuned away or are actually with the operating system. So don't lose hope!</p>
<p>(*For my German readers, this is an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=saturday+night+live+floor+wax+dessert+topping">SNL reference,</a> so you won't get it.)</p>
