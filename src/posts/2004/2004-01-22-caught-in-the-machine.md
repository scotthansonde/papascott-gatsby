<p><a title="Trip Home From Europe Becomes Kafkaesque Ordeal" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/21/nyregion/21detain.html?ex=1390107600&en=3765c7ad8a725cf8&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">NY Times: Trip Home From Europe Becomes Kafkaesque Ordeal</a> "A German woman married to a Brooklyn schoolteacher had been told that she had all her papers in order when she took a quick trip to show off her infant daughter to her parents in Germany. But her return home in late December turned surreal and terrifying when Homeland Security officials at Kennedy Airport rejected her travel documents, confiscated her passport, then detained her and the 3-month-old overnight in a room with shackled drug suspects. They let her go only after ordering her to leave the country no later than tomorrow."</p>
