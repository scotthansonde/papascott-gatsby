<p>Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero told Der Spiegel that the EU could become a global power with a foreign ministry within 20 years. That's sweet coming from a politican who had his country perform an instant about-face on Iraq upon his election. If foreign issues are resolved more on the basis of party politics rather than national interest, how can te EU of 25 have any sort of coherent foreign policy at all? Right now the EU <em>might</em> be able to agree that the Earth is round and rotates around the sun, but only if Italy abstains. <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/041106120808.wl2psr92" title="EUbusiness - EU can become global power in 20 years: Spanish PM">(EUbusiness - EU can become global power in 20 years: Spanish PM)</a></p>
