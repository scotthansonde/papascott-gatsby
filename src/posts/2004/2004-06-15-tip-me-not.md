<p>I joined the <a href="http://hermes.zeit.de/EM-Tipp/" title="EM-Tippspiel">Euro pool at zeit.de</a> (pointed to by <a href="http://jimmiz.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=424" title="EM-Tippspiel [jimmiz journal]">Jim</a>, and after the first 3 days my result is so remarkable that I should post my picks here, so you have an idea of what's <em>not</em> to happen. I have one (un, eins, uno) point, and it took a herioc effort by Zidane to achieve that. Yesterday, for example, I picked Italy to win and Sweden to tie. Today I've picked the Czechs and Holland to win, so things are looking good for a couple of upsets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=323">Nico</a> is complaining about the announcing talents of Reinhold Beckmann. They must not get ZDF in Lummaland, because there's <em>nobody</em> worse (not even Faßblinder) than Johannes B. (as in Brainless) Kerner. Meanwhile <a href="http://www.neilarmstrong.de/weblog/2004_06_01_archive.html#108721607705602524">Neil</a> is going on about the wonderful German announcers, which I guess means the British have it even worse than anyone had imagined. (I personally use a face-recognition system on my TV that activates the mute button whenever Beckenbauer's face appears on the screen.)</p>
