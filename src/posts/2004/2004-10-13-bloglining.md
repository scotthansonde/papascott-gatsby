<p>If anyone cares, the blogroll published here is now taken from my <a title="Bloglines | Free, Web-Based News Aggregator" href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> account, since that's where I do 90% of my reading these days. I can't pull timestamp information from Bloglines (yet), so the last-updated times are still from Blogrolling and blo.gs. Since the URLs often don't match among the three services, the timestamp may be missing or plain wrong. It's a work in progress.</p>
