<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/feet.jpg" height="331" width="400" border="0" alt="feet.jpg: Mama's feet, her cat, and her computer" /></p>
<p>T minus 12 days and counting. Mama has been taking acupuncture, drinking raspberry-leaf tea, breathing rose oil, going in for lymph drainage, swallowing tiny homeopathic sugar balls. Her doctor says the baby will be at least 4 kilos. (The cat, Karl-Heinz, is over 7 kilos, by the way.) I wanted to take a picture of her bare foot, but she hid it in time... you can barely see a toe behind her sock. (<i>Oh no! She has discovered the "Discuss" page and has posted <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$22">a response</a>!</i>)</p>
<p>I've been using Gphoto and the Gimp under Linux to prepare these pictures. Gphoto was easier to get working than was the included software for Windows on Mama's computer.</p>
<p>VA Linux finally confirmed... I'm in! db alex.brown never did find my original paperwork, but let me fax it in again.</p>
<p>Mama's boss gave her a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0590353403/mausnewsletter05">Harry Potter</a> book for Christmas. Not exactly what you'd expect from a management type.</p>
