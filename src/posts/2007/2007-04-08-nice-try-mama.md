<p>MamaMaus brought home this picture and said it would be good for PapaScott. File it under McDonald's humor that McDonald's people find funny. If you've never sent a child to a German school, this is obviously a school lunch <em>Pausenbrot</em> in a different wrapping.</p>
<p>It seems to come from an <a href="http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2464453">ad campaign for McDonald's Austria</a>.</p>
<p>No, we don't do this. We wrap Christopher's <em>Pausenbrot</em> in normal waxed paper like all other parents.</p>
