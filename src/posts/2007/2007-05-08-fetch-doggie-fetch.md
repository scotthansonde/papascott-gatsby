<p><a href="http://sprechblase.wordpress.com/2007/05/06/aua/">Cem</a> passed on this questionaire to me. For some reason, in German these questionaires are called a <em>Stöckchen</em>, a stick you throw for a dog to fetch. So I'm obediently picking up the stick...</p>
<p><strong>Do you use social bookmarking/networking sites like Digg, Yigg, Mister Wong or Del.Icio.Us?</strong> I use del.icio.us, but not regularly. It's much easier to share links on Google Reader.</p>
<p><strong>Do you watch videos at portals like YouTube, Sevenload or DailyMotion an?</strong> Not really, I find the written word more interesting than moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know of or use Flickr?</strong> I use Flickr only as an image store. I don't use any of the social features.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of services like Twitter or Frazr?</strong> I don't know yet. I've tried Twitter, but I don't get it.</p>
<p><strong>How many RSS feeds do you subscribe to?</strong> 322 at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Do you read them all daily?</strong> No. I have my feeds grouped by priority, some to read immediately, some to read daily, and some to check when I have the chance.</p>
<p><strong>How many blogs do you write for (own or as co-author)?</strong> Only one. I've tried starting a second blog for non-personal topics, but found it too schizophrenic.</p>
<p><strong>Do you comment in other blogs?</strong> Not as often as I would like.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your personal Blog King of Germany?</strong> I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective. (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/quotes">source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Do you think weblogs belong to the futures, or are they just a temporary hype?</strong> I've been "blogging" in one form or another since I was 16 years old. Back then I used a typewriter and a mimeograph, now I use the internet. It's just a medium.</p>
<p><strong>Will you blog be a part of that future?</strong> I will be writing in some form or another.</p>
<p><strong>Are we alone in the Universe?</strong> Does it matter? Knowing for sure one way or the other wouldn't change me or my life at all.</p>
<p><strong>Who's next to answer these questions?</strong> Whoever is brave enough to try.</p>
