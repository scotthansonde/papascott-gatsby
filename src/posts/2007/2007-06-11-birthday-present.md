<p>MamaMaus has her birthday today, and Christopher wanted to make her something special, something for the new restaurant. He decided on an "M" logo for her office... sure, she can get plenty of logos, but how many of them are hand-painted?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/540319606/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1080/540319606_015a045316.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2062" /></a></p>
<p>We made all the preparations on Saturday. We had to buy the cardboard, a tube of yellow paint, and a artist's palette. And since Mama has offices both at home and at work, he had to of course create two.</p>

<p>I was more practical in my gift selection. To help us adjust to our new lifestyle, I found a some books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.de/Kunst-stilvollen-Verarmens-ohne-reich/dp/3499616688/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/302-5032874-9994428?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181556096&amp;sr=8-1" title="Die Kunst des stilvollen Verarmens. Wie man ohne Geld reich wird">Die Kunst des stilvollen Verarmens. Wie man ohne Geld reich wird</a> (The Art of Stylishly Becoming Poorer: How to Become Rich Without Money) </li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/031236198X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/105-2606337-0531609?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181556897&amp;sr=8-2" title="Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions">Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions</a>. </li>
<li>Plus a book on Feng-Shui, to make sure we don't make any fatal mistakes when designing the McCafé.</li>
</ul>
