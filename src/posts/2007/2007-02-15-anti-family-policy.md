<p>Some news items from Germany are just too gruesome to be translated into other languages. Take family policy. Both <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2348164,00.html">DW-World</a> and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,466443,00.html">Spiegel International</a> will report in English on Germany's poor showing in the UNICEF study of child welfare, but the views of certain German politicians remain untranslated. But all is not lost, we will venture into the crypt, and PapaScott will explain and translate <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3261">the gory details</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="http://de.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&amp;storyID=2007-02-14T165037Z_01_HUM460621_RTRDEOC_0_DEUTSCHLAND-FAMILIE-UNION-2ZF.xml">Berlin (Reuters)</a> - In spite of the support of the CDU leadership, Family Minister is facing increasing criticism in the Union for her plan to increase day care for small children.</p>
<p>  Union parliamentary leader Volker Kauder warned against concentrating on the family model with a working mother. "I think that's wrong" he told the  "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung". The federal budget should also not be tapped for the financing of hundreds of thousands of day care places, as suggested by von der Leyen. That is a matter for the states. Thüringen CDU General Secretary Mike Mohring accused the minister of scaring away traditional Union voters. The CSU state leader in the Bundestag, Peter Ramsauer, stated that the minister does not represent the image of the family of many Union party members.

<p>Yes, you read that right, and these quotes are from 2007, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bund_Deutscher_M%C3%A4del">1937</a>. These politicians <em>deliberately</em> make it difficult for women to choose both a career and a family. And then they wonder why Germany does so badly in international comparisons of child welfare and education.</p>
<p>Given that in half the households in Germany the woman is smarter and would have better earning potential than the man (MamaMaus would say it's more like 80%), then Germany is missing out on half (or 80%) of its current potential, not to mention the future that is being wasted by such Neanderthal views. This is not family policy, this is anti-family policy.</p>
