<p>Tomorrow Christopher's school is celebrating <a href="http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa020501a.htm"><em>Fasching</em></a>... here are the main components of his costume. Aficionados of 20th century German children's literature can probably guess what will come of it.</p>
<p>Here in northern Germany <em>Fasching</em> or <em>Karneval</em> is strictly for children, unlike in lesser developed parts of the country (although some towns near us celebrate <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faslam"><em>Faslam</em></a>, which seems to be <em>Karneval</em> reduced to the bare essentials: getting drunk in a clown costume).</p>
