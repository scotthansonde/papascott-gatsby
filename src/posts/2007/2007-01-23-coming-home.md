<p>The <a href="http://www.radiohamburg.de/index.html?webseiteID=1550&amp;webcontainerID=9094">Bundestagkantine</a> radio show this morning (on the investigation of whether the Schröder government hindered the release of Murat Kurnaz from Guantanamo) wasn't particularly funny, although the comment that "with that beard we thought he was <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/bio/T/thierwo0.html">Wolfgang Thierse</a>" was mildly amusing.</p>
<p>However, it was very funny that the next song on Radio Hamburg was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKVAV3qSb8U">"Coming Home" by Sasha</a>.</p>
