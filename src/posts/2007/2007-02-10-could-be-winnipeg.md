<p>You know the weather's cold when the best thing you can say about is <a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2007/2/9/2721696.html">"it could be worse, we could be in Winnipeg"</a>. Or when you can point out the little used fact that "-40 is where the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales meet".</p>
<p>Considering that cities have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_island">heat island</a> that raises the temperature by about 5°C, it's even colder than it sounds. The coldest I've experienced was -31°F on a sunny day in Minneapolis. (Minnesotans often brag about the wind chill, but I'm talking about actual temperature.)</p>
<p>By the way, it's not that cold here. It's a balmy -2°C with 5 cm of snow that will be gone by tomorrow evening.</p>
