<p>O'Reilly Net: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/sysadmin/2007/05/03/the-top-7-things-sysadmins-forget-to-do.html">Top 7 Things System Administrators Forget to Do</a>. I'll admit to being guilty of all of these at some time or another, but I try especially hard to avoid number 7:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Forgetting Courtesy</p>

Regardless of that possibility, system administrators should always remember that their clients are internal and if you want to keep your job, be good to your clients.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We can be smart and help people without being arrogant. It's more fun that way.</p>
