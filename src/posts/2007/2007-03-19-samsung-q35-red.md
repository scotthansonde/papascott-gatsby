<p>We're looking at a new notebook for MamaMaus. Since I don't think I can talk her into an Apple ("I don't want to learn anything new!"), I asked her what features she needed. "It needs to be small," she said, "and powerful." That wasn't a big help.</p>
<p>Then she added, "I saw a red notebook from Samsung that looked pretty good." Well, if color is a main criterion, at least that limits the field somewhat. And the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/products/mobilecomputing/qseries/np_q35t007suk.asp">Samsung Q35 Red</a> actually seems pretty good.</p>
