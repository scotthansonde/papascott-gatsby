<p>Yesterday I left my wallet at home when I drove to work. At 5 am, I'm lucky to remember anything on my way out. Unfortunately, I didn't notice my wallet was missing until after work and I had just filled my tank at the Aral gas station across the street from the restaurant.</p>
<p>The only thing I had of value to leave as a deposit was my car registration. The woman behind the counter didn't want to take it at first... what if I got stopped by the police, I would need my registration. I talked her into it, as I had nothing else to offer, and she let me return 30 minutes later with EC card to pay for my diesel.</p>
<p>Her concern was typically German and actually pretty silly. If I would really have been stopped, having a stolen tank of gas and no driver's license would have interested the police much more the missing registration. :-)</p>
