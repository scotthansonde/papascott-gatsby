<p><a href="http://www.onezblog.de/item/250">Soeren asked me</a> what I would consider the best albums of all time or most important to me. I decided both "best" and "important" were uninteresting (and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/500albums">best</a> has already been done). I decided to list "favorite" instead, albums I like and listen to, even though they may not be the best, and maybe next week my list would be different. I did limit myself to one pick per artist. In order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dirty Mind, Prince</li>
<li>Rocket to Russia, Ramones</li>
<li>Born to Run, Bruce Springsteen</li>
<li>London Calling, The Clash</li>
<li>Making Movies, Dire Straits</li>
<li>Achtung Baby, U2</li>
<li>Talk Show, Go-Go's</li>
<li>Planet Punk, Die Ärzte</li>
<li>So, Peter Gabriel</li>
</ul>
<p>He listed nine, so I did too (though the 9th was the hardest to pick). For the moment I won't explain my choices, maybe later. Feel free to tell me in the comments why my picks suck.</p>
