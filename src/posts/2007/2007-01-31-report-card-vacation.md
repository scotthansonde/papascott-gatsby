<p>This week the schoolkids in Niedersachsen get 2 days off school for *Zeugnisferien*, or report card vacation. As far as I know, the first graders at Christopher's school don't even get report cards, but they get the days off anyway. </p>
<p>Even better, today his school lets out at 10 am, after exactly 90 minutes in class. So working parents lose 3 days instead of 2. </p>
<p>That din you'll be hearing in the background is the sound of somewhat more chaos than usual.</p>
