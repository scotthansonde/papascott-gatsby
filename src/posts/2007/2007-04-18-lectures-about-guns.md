<p>In the wake of the shootings in at Virginia Tech, there have been the usual comments in the German media about the lack of gun control laws in the US. I can think of a few ways to point the finger back here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest employer in my wife's home town is <a href="http://www.sauer-waffen.de/index.php?id=sauer&amp;lang=en">Sauer &amp; Sohn</a>, "Germany's oldest's gun manufacturer" since 250 years.</li>
<li>
<p>In 2006 there were nearly 350,000 registered hunters in Germany</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we live, the main social club in most towns is the <em>Schützenverein</em>, or shooting club. The biggest social event of the year is the <em>Schützenfest</em>, where shooting is combined with alcohol. The <a href="http://www.germany-tourism.de/ENG/destination_germany/master_tlevents-id1099-fstadt_event_allgemein.htm?cc_lang="><em>Schützenfest</em></a> in Hannover can be compared with the Oktoberfest in Munich or the Dom in Hamburg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we just moved here I was told I could make big money smuggling trigger mechanisms from the US into Germany. Gun fans in Germany could import non-functional weapons from the US, but the mechanisms were not so easy to get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems every few months there is a gun accident involving children here, almost always involving a legal but unlocked gun from a parent. The US National Rifle Association may be a gun lobby, but they also teach basic gun safety, which includes keeping one's guns locked when stored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, Andrew at German Joys <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2007/04/guns_and_tirade.html">makes the point</a> much more logically than I ever could. Lax gun laws in the US make life slighty unsafer than in Europe, but only slightly. It's not enough to get on your high horse.</p>
