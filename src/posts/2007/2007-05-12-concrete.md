<p>Our plans for <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/03/27/bricks-and-mortar/">taking over the restaurant</a> on 1 July are slowing becoming concrete.</p>
<ul>
<li>MamaMaus' last day of work at the office is Monday. On Tuesday she begins in-store training (at a company restaurant, not our future location). Her employment officially ends on 30 June.</li>
<li>
<p>The papers for the GmbH will be signed on Wednesday. The tax advisor says we don't need the 'Co KG', so we're skipping it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written notice of the change in ownership will be posted at the restaurant on Monday, and a formal employee meeting is scheduled a week later. At that point I can say here where we will be located (but if you ask me by mail, I'll tell you).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The franchise contract (over 2 cm thick) arrived by courier yesterday, so we now have a final purchase price that can be signed and sent back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update 15 May 2007:</strong> MamaMaus was afraid the tone of this post would be misunderstood, so it's been edited to more accurately reflect our true feelings of giddiness and excitement.</p>
