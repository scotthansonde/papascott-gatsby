<p>T-minus 8 days. The outgoing manager at our soon-to-be restaurant was gracious enough to allow me to work a few shifts behind the counter before we take over (with no monetary compensation, of course). I've been concentrating on the kitchen, since that's where the most changes have taken place since 1994, when I last ran a shift at a restaurant. I won't be running shifts full time, since my main priority is still a little boy who's about to finish the first grade, but I can fill in for late shifts during the week. </p>
<p>After two days I can say the changes in the kitchen are all for the better (especially being able to see orders as they are being placed), but after over a decade of desk work, I'm going to have to get used to being on my feet all day. Oh, my dogs are tired!</p>
