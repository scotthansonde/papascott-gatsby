<p>Nico has yet <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3422">another new project</a>, namely a technical job board entitled <a href="http://webzweinulljobs.de/">webzweinulljobs.de</a>, born from his experience how difficult it is to find good administrators and developers. I say that anything that keeps him from making more <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/08/25/nico-ballmer/">recruitment videos</a> is a good idea.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that <a href="http://webzweinulljobs.de/job/system-administratoren-innen/">my job</a> at Media Ventures is listed, and I don't even meet the qualifications anymore (I don't know the right firewall). Do you think they are trying to tell me something?</p>
