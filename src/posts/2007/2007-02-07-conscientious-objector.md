<p>In case you wonder why developers are so difficult to work with, <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3248">Nico heard this</a> in our office in Cologne:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I reject <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> for reasons of conscience.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Try explaining that to a client when your project is late and over budget. "We could have used a better framework, but our development team thought it was immoral."</p>
