<p>The current political headline topic, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,511333,00.html">whether the government should hire juveniles</a> to test whether shops sell alcohol and cigarettes to minors, seems pretty dumb to me. Why don't they just hire adults that look young and give them fake IDs?</p>
