<p>The Shopblogger Björn Harste is <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5203-24-Stunden-geoeffnet.html">taking advantage</a> of the extended shopping hours in Bremen and is now opening his Spar supermarket 24 hours from Monday through Saturday. He <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5205-14-Kunden.html">blogged</a> <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5208-gaehn.html">through</a> the <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5214-Bilanz-der-ersten-Nachtoeffnung.html">night</a> his "first night out".</p>
<p>Of course for restaurants 24 hour opening is nothing new or special. We are already open until 3 am (4 am on weekends). We're considering going 24 hours ourselves (at least in the Drive-Thru), not so much for the sales as for daily maintenance and security. There's always something to clean.</p>
