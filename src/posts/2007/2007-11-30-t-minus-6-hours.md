<p>Officially we re-open tomorrow at 7 am, but we're hoping to have things cleaned up this afternoon so we can serve guests inside this evening.</p>
<p>Even with all the debris in the way, several guests per hour will fight their way to the door only to be disappointed by the closed lobby. Give us a few more hours, please!</p>
