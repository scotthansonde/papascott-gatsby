<p>This morning is the big meeting with the bank. In the middle of preparing her presentation, MamaMaus came storming into the living room. "I am an eagle!" she cried, which confused Christopher to no end. But if it helps to convince the Deutsche Bank, she can be whatever she wants.</p>
<p>Eagles work alone, so the vulture will stay home at the nest and cross his fingers.</p>
