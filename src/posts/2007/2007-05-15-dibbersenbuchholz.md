<p>Now that official notice of the upcoming change in ownership has been posted in the restaurant, I am proud to announce that the first location of the Frauke Petersen-Hanson Systemgastronomie GmbH i.G. will be located at **Harburger Str. 19 in Dibbersen/Buchholz**, on the Autobahn A1 between Bremen and Hamburg. For us the restaurant is just 10 minutes drive from home.</p>

<p>The restaurant with McDrive was opened in 2003 and does not yet have a McCafé. It is located near a thriving commercial area with the furniture store Möbel Kraft and a new Obi home improvement store. A Famila supermarket and a MediaMarkt electronics store are planned for this year. We have every reason to expect satisfaction and success for years to come.</p>
<p>**Update:** MamaMaus has a soft spot for signage. This will be ours.</p>
