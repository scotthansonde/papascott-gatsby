<blockquote><p>
  In a <a href="http://www.technomic.com/pressroom/corporate_social_4_07.html">recent study</a> of U.S. consumer attitudes toward corporate social responsibility in foodservice, Technomic found that restaurant users rated health insurance coverage, living wages and animal welfare as their top three concerns, when asked to select among 14 different issues.</p>
<p>  In general, consumers believe restaurant chains could do more to address their high priority social issues. The chains that consumers view as being most socially responsible are McDonalds, Chick-fil-A, Subway, Starbucks and Applebees.

<p>Interesting that healthy menu and obesity weren't among the top issues. It is also interesting that in Germany corporate responsibility seems to be a non-issue. Corporations are assumed to be irresponsible, and any effort to demonstrate social responsibility is dismissed as a PR gag. Or am I wrong?</p>
