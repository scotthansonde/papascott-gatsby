<p>I finally have some time to answer some questions from the audience. I'll start with <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/06/26/100-hours/#comment-34515">DaveP</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Are you going to have McBier?
</p></blockquote>
<p>The restaurant currently does sell beer (Bitburger in bottles), but we will be dropping it. Beer is a standard menu item in Germany, but it's a very low seller. We'd only sell 3 or 4 each day. The permit to sell beer costs 960 per year, so we didn't have to think very hard to decide that it was not worth it. Instead we will offer alcohol-free beer, which fits in better with the image we want to present anyway.</p>
<p>There's an Aral gas station across the street, and anyone who really wants beer would go there in the first place. They have better selection and don't pour the beer into a paper cup.</p>
