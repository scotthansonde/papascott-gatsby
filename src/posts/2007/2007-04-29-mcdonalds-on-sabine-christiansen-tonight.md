<p>Tonight's <a href="http://www.sabinechristiansen.de/">Sabine Christiansen</a> talk show on ARD is on the topic of obesity, and among the guests is <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/presse/basis/vorstand/goebel.html">Wolfgang Goebel</a>, Vice President for Operations for McDonald's Deutschland (and, for a few more days, MamaMaus' boss).</p>
<p>We're no big fans of Christiansen, but her show is the best known talk show on German television. We usually don't stay up until 21:45 on Sunday nights, but tonight we might make an exception. I do suspect, though, that the producers deliberately chose a soft topic for the holiday weekend.</p>
