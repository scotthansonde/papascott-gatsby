<p>Spiegel Online International: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,554866,00.html">Afghan Girl's Death Sparks National Debate</a>. This is the story of a 16-year-old girl in Hamburg stabbed to death by her older brother. One of our best employees in Dibbersen is related to the family and attended the funeral. He told us the family has been very hurt by how the media has protrayed them the past week. As you read the story, try to find the line between the truth and trying to fit the story into a pre-set "Muslims in Germany" mold.</p>
