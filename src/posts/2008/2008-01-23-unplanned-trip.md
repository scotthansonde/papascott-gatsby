<p>I got the news this morning that my brother is sick, sick enough that I've dropped everything to fly to Minnesota right away to be with him and my family for a few days. This time of year it's easy to find seats (high temp in MSP today: -16&deg;C). Got to find lots of long underwear before I go...</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've arrived in Minnesota, my brother is stable and doing better. Thanks for all the well wishes!</p>
