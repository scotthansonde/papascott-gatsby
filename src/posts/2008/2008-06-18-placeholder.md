<p>The last thing I expected when we went to a McDonald's meeting the past two days was to be berated for not updating my blog for over a week. But that's what happened, at the bar after the disappointing German game against Austria at Euro 2008. </p>
<p>So for the McDonald's insiders who follow our restaurant via PapaScott... we just got our second ISC for the month, and while the TET was a bit high (so no perfect score), we have a zero CSO for the fourth month in a row. </p>
